<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have attempted in this monograph to give some account of the Lhota Nagas, a tribe
whose dour attitude towards inquirers has caused them to be somewhat neglected in
the past. Boasting no great knowledge of anthropology, I have avoided theories and
confined myself to facts. During some three years’ residence at Mokokchung as Assistant
Commissioner I have had considerable opportunity of becoming acquainted with the habits
and customs of this tribe, many individual members of which are now my personal friends.
</p>
<p>The generosity of the Assam Government has made the publication of this monograph
possible, and my thanks are due to my many friends who have assisted me in the preparation
of it. But for the encouragement and advice of Mr. J.&nbsp;H. Hutton, Deputy Commissioner
of the Naga Hills and Director of Ethnography in Assam, it would probably never have
been written. He has helped me throughout in every possible way, and has contributed
a most valuable introduction and notes. I am further indebted to Mr. Hutton for six
photographs and a drawing, while for two other photographs my thanks are due to Mr.
S.&nbsp;G. Butler. I have further to thank Miss A.&nbsp;M. Grace of Hove for the coloured frontispiece
and Miss E.&nbsp;M. Paterson for the drawing of the median bands of the two types of <i lang="njh">rükhusü</i>. <abbr title="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lt.-Col.</abbr> J. Shakespear has been kind enough to do the index for me.
</p>
<p>It is through the hearty co-operation of my Lhota friends that I have been able to
make some record of their tribal customs and beliefs, and my thanks are especially
due <span class="pageNum" id="pb.vi">[<a href="#pb.vi">vi</a>]</span>to Etsisao and Chongsemo of Okotso, Asao and Chamimo of Pangti, Santemo of Niroyo,
Ranchamo of Seleku, Yanasao of Akuk, and Shambemo of Tsingaki. Tsansao, of the staff
of the Sub-divisional Officer, Mokokchung, gave me invaluable assistance in recording
folk-tales and typing my manuscript.
</p>
<p>The only previous account of Lhota customs which I have seen is that given by Mr.
Hutton on pp. 362–370 of <i>The Angami Nagas</i> (Macmillan, 1921). Other investigators of Naga customs have, as a rule, dismissed
them with a few words. Dr. W.&nbsp;E. Wither’s <i>Outline Grammar of the Lhota Naga Language</i> (Calcutta, 1888) I found most useful.

<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When I made over charge of the Mokokchung Subdivision of the Naga Hills to Mr. Mills
in November 1917, I urged him to study in particular the Lhota tribe with a view to
writing a monograph on them. The reason why I selected the Lhotas was that it appeared
to me that they, more than any other tribe in the Naga Hills District, were beginning
to lose their distinctive features and were in danger of early denationalization between
the upper and the nether mill-stones of Christianity, as taught by the American Baptist
Mission, and Hinduism, as practised by the Nepali settler or by the Assamese who are
the neighbours of the Lhota on the plains side. It was already a very rare thing to
see a Lhota in ceremonial dress, and it was a, to me, unpleasantly common thing to
have Lhota ceremonies and the officials of the Lhota hierarchy spoken of in spurious
terms of Hinduism. The Baptist Mission, with its headquarters at “Impur” in the Ao
country, was at work in the north, and one of the first disputes I had to deal with
when I went to Mokokchung in 1913 was a complaint from the village of Pangti that
a missionary had been initiating his converts by immersing them in the village spring,
to which the village elders objected both on sanitary and religious (or, if you will,
superstitious) grounds on the lines of Tennyson’s Churchwarden when he complained
of the Baptists—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“<span class="corr" id="xd31e603" title="Source: They weshed their nasty sins in my pond, and it poisoned the cow.">They wesh’d their sins i’ <i>my</i> pond, an’ I doubts they poison’d the cow.</span>”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The Hindu tendency was most noticeable in the south, and it was at Kohima that one
of my Lhota interpreters, by <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xii">[<a href="#pb.xii">xii</a>]</span>his office the natural guardian and exponent of tribal customs, came to me to ask
for leave, as his village was about to perform the “Lakshmi puja,” by which he meant
the <i lang="njh">Rangsikam</i>.
</p>
<p>I am happy in thinking that not only have Mr. Mills’ efforts in investigating the
customs and beliefs of the Lhota tribe succeeded in putting them on record while there
was yet time, but they have also incidentally contributed not a little to revivify
their observance. For there is no question but that they had begun to lose their hold.
The prohibition of head-hunting alone was bound to act in that direction. In one small
and decaying village (Lisio) Mr. Mills found that there had been no <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>, and therefore presumably no communal ceremonies, for twenty years. There is now
a <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> and the ceremonial life of the village has acquired fresh vigour, and I have some
hopes that the decay that had set in may be thereby staved off, for it cannot contribute
to healthy life to be deprived entirely of all public and communal ceremonies, and
to revive them may do good. Again, at Okotso, when I first knew it, about a third
of the village had turned Christian: the remainder, having observed that no immediate
disaster seemed to follow the forsaking of ancestral customs, but being in no wise
desirous to take up the burden of the angel of the Church of Impur, who looks with
disapproval on tobacco and the national dress and insists on total prohibition as
regards fermented liquor, had lapsed into a spiritual limbo in which they observed
no religious customs at all. The “morungs” had fallen into decay and the young men
would not take the trouble to renew them; the village ceremonies, if observed at all,
were observed in the most perfunctory manner, and the community as a whole took neither
part nor interest, giving at best an apathetic conformity not perhaps entirely unparalleled
in modern Britain. How far it is due to Mr. Mills’ interest in Lhota custom I do not
know, but the non-Christian population of Okotso has certainly reformed, rebuilt its
“morungs,” and re-instituted the <i lang="njh">Oyantsoa</i> in its fullness.
</p>
<p>The hill country in which the Lhota lives is a very <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiii">[<a href="#pb.xiii">xiii</a>]</span>beautiful one indeed. I am sitting on the banks of the Dayang as I write, and if the
Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, are one whit as lovely as the Dayang and
the Chebi, then verily had Naaman the right of it. But the Lhota himself has not been
fortunate in his critics. From Lieut. Bigge, the first to make his acquaintance, in
1841, down to even Col. Woods, whose acquaintance with the Lhota ended in 1912, he
has been stigmatized as surly, sullen, or sulky. Yet it is most undeserved. Absurdly
sensitive to ridicule, and, partly no doubt for that reason, extremely reticent, he
is not near so readily moved to hilarity as his neighbour the Sema, or even the Angami.
Dour he is, and very canny; hardly could even Mr. Punch’s Aberdonian better him in
the virtue (or is it “vice”?) of thrift. If the Sema among Naga tribes be likened
to the Irishman (I think the comparison is Mr. Mills’ originally), then the Lhota
is the Scot among them. He is far from inhospitable and I think he has been misjudged,
because his critics, while having more than the casual acquaintance which is predisposed
to be attracted by the manly hill man, and having discovered that he is not so delightful
a person as one would like to believe, have never penetrated to the real intimacy
which would have ended in a very mutual esteem. Possibly too they may have judged
him in some cases from the point of view from which La Fontaine writes of his cat,
</p>
<div lang="fr" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“<i>Cet animal est <span class="corr" id="xd31e635" title="Not in source">très</span> méchant;</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i>Quand on l’attaque il se défend!</i>”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and it must be admitted that the Naga, suspicious of strangers as he is, is a little
apt to defend himself before he has been attacked at all. However that may be, I can
state without reserve that Mr. Mills, during the three and a half years in which he
has had to decide their disputes and deal with the Lhotas in various ways, has fully
gained their confidence—without it this book could not have been written—and has doubtless
found them, as I have myself, very pleasant companions, particularly on the river
or in the jungle or after dangerous game.
</p>
<p>The Lhota occupies to some extent a midway position <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiv">[<a href="#pb.xiv">xiv</a>]</span>among Naga tribes between the cultures typical of the north and of the south, and
is particularly interesting as retaining very clear indications of the composite origin
of the tribe. The main body are perhaps of the same origin as the Sangtams, and hence
from the south, perhaps from the Chindwin valley in Burma to which the Southern Sangtams
trace their origin. Thence there are traditions of Lhota sojourners at Kezakenoma
(Keshur) and at Kohima in the present Angami country, and at Themoketsa and the extinct
village of the hero Pembvo in the Rengma country. Indeed it is now no longer quite
clear whether this chief was a Lhota or a Rengma, and whether he protected against
the pursuing Angamis the rearguard of the Lhotas crossing the Dayang northwards, or
that of the Rengmas migrating westwards to the Mikir Hills, but the Lhotas of the
neighbouring villages jealously preserve his memory and all that touches him, while
Chankerhomo, who is associated with him in legend and who slew in one day thirty Angami
warriors of Phekekrima, only to be eventually captured and tortured to death by them,
was undoubtedly a Lhota and the site of his execution is still shown. Indubitably
the Lhotas have been subject to the influence of the same cultures as the Angamis,
and it may be seen in their practice of the erection of monoliths on the performance
of certain ceremonies, in the practice of burial and in the manner of taking omens,
which both Angami and Lhota do by dropping chips cut from a reed instead of by the
fire-stick like other Naga tribes. Like that of the Angamis too is the Lhota social
organization into three phratries, though it is conceivable that in both tribes the
use of the word <i lang="njh">apfu</i> for mother, as in one phratry, is of southern or eastern origin and the use of <i lang="njh">azo</i> or <i lang="njh">oyo</i> by the others is of the western immigration from the plains of Assam, where <i lang="njh">ayo</i> is still the Assamese word for ‘mother.’ The Rengmas, however, very like the Lhotas
in many respects, and having a similar dual system, seem to have migrated generally
from east to west, the bulk of the Rengma tribe having moved from the Naga Hills westward
across the Dhansiri valley to the Mikir Hills only a hundred years ago.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xv">[<a href="#pb.xv">xv</a>]</span></p>
<p>Alongside the traces of immigration from the south we have the clear tradition among
the Lhotas of an origin from the Himalayas and the plains of Assam, and the use of
the cross-bow, the tradition of the <i lang="njh">tsonak</i> and the strictly preserved <i lang="njh">yanthang</i> “daos” alike connect the Lhota with the north bank of the Brahmaputra, or with the
Singphos.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, we have stories of fighting stones and of girls that came out of oranges
or bamboo shoots<a class="noteRef" id="n.xv.1src" href="#n.xv.1">1</a> almost identical in form with stories told by the Khasis,<a class="noteRef" id="n.xv.2src" href="#n.xv.2">2</a> and traceable perhaps to Bodo or Mon-Khmêr survivals. The Lhotas too are prolific
in families descended from “jungle men” <span class="corr" id="xd31e681" title="Source: taught">caught</span> and kept as slaves.
</p>
<p>In the remaining pages of the Introduction I have endeavoured to give a general idea
of the composition of the Naga tribes with a view to a better appreciation of the
position among them of the Lhota tribe itself, and of the significance of many points
in Mr. Mills’ account of that tribe.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>It is generally assumed in a vague sort of way that those tribes which are spoken
of as Nagas have something in common with each other which distinguishes them from
the many other tribes found in Assam and entitles them to be regarded as a racial
unit in themselves. It has been asserted that the Naga tribes are marked by a very
strong affection for their village sites in contradistinction to the Kukis and perhaps
other tribes like the Garos and Hill Kacharis.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xv.3src" href="#n.xv.3">3</a> But this love of old sites, even if true of most Naga tribes, is certainly not true
of all and really exists in a very marked degree rather among the Angamis than among
Nagas as such, while even the Angamis can recount their genealogies back to a time
when their tribe was still in that migratory stage still characteristic, more or less,
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvi">[<a href="#pb.xvi">xvi</a>]</span>Kukis, Garos and the Sema Nagas, and probably not far distant in the past of the Kacha
Naga tribes. The truth is that if not impossible it is exceedingly difficult to propound
any test by which a Naga tribe can be distinguished from other Assam and Burma tribes
which are not Nagas.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xvi.1src" href="#n.xvi.1">4</a>
</p>
<p>The expression “Naga”<a class="noteRef" id="n.xvi.2src" href="#n.xvi.2">5</a> is, however, useful as an arbitrary term to denote the tribes living in certain parts
of the Assam hills, which may be roughly defined as bounded by the Hukong valley in
the north-east, the plains of the Brahmaputra valley to the north-west, of Cachar
to the south-west and of the Chindwin to the east. In the south the Manipur valley
roughly marks the point of contact between the “Naga” tribes and the very much more
closely interrelated group of Kuki tribes—Thado, Lushei, Chin, etc.
</p>
<p>This area now occupied by the Naga tribes is known to have been subject to at least
three great immigrations of races from different directions. Thus there is known to
have been (1) immigration from the direction of Tibet and Nepal;<a class="noteRef" id="n.xvi.3src" href="#n.xvi.3">6</a> the Singphos are known to have come from this direction, and it is probable that
the Akas, Mishmis<a class="noteRef" id="n.xvi.4src" href="#n.xvi.4">7</a> and other tribes of the north bank of the Brahmaputra did also, while the Bodo tribes—Garos,
Mikirs and Kacharis—<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xvii">[<a href="#pb.xvii">xvii</a>]</span>certainly came from the same direction. There has also been (2) immigration from the
direction of Southern China across the valley of the Irawadi,<a class="noteRef" id="n.xvii.1src" href="#n.xvii.1">8</a> of which movement the Tai races—Shans, Ahoms, Tamans, etc.—formed part. And at the
same time there has been (3) immigration from the south which has barely stopped now,
for the Lushei-Kuki migration was still progressing northwards until 1918, when it
was only just prevented from spreading into the unexplored area north of the Ti-Ho
(Nantaleik) river by driving the newly-formed colonies on the north bank back across
the river at the end of the rains in 1918 before the operations against the Kukis
opened in the following cold weather. By that time the Kukis in their attempt to migrate
north had already attacked Makware.
</p>
<p>The Lushei, Thado and other Kuki tribes are perhaps themselves another branch of the
northern immigration,<a class="noteRef" id="n.xvii.2src" href="#n.xvii.2">9</a> but if so they must have turned north again, for they drove up from the south in
front of them both the old Kukis—possibly non-Kuki tribes<a class="noteRef" id="n.xvii.3src" href="#n.xvii.3">10</a> already subjected to Kuki influence—and that very different race which became the
predominating factor in the Angami Naga tribe, and which has probably entered to a
lesser degree into the composition of a number of its neighbours. The Angamis or the
ancestors of a section of what is now the Angami tribe were undoubtedly located far
to the south of the present Naga Hills.
</p>
<p>In addition to these immigrants we have (4) still another element in the Kol-Mon-Annam
occupation which almost certainly extended over part of the area now inhabited by
Naga tribes.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xvii.4src" href="#n.xvii.4">11</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xviii">[<a href="#pb.xviii">xviii</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is evidence to support a contention that traces of all these race movements
are to be found in the culture and composition of the tribes now occupying the Naga
Hills and known collectively as “Nagas.”
</p>
<p>First of all we have the Naga traditions of origin themselves, indicating, as one
would expect to find, almost all the points of the compass. From Tamlu northwards
there are the various Konyak tribes, whose traditions of origin at least include an
ascription of their origin to the hills to the north and to migration from the plains
in the west or north-west as well, though others, perhaps with Singpho affinities,
reached their present country from the north-east, while one or two Konyak villages,
indistinguishable from the Konyaks generally in culture, claim an origin from the
country to the south of them at present occupied by Aos. Like the Konyaks, the Aos
claim a part origin from the plains to the north-west, though the bulk of the tribe
claims an autochthonous source at Chongliemdi.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xviii.1src" href="#n.xviii.1">12</a> The Khoirao again, or some of them, for the Khoirao Naga villages are hardly uniform
enough to be described as forming a tribe, claim a western origin from the plains
of Assam, and this in particular is the case with Ngari and perhaps one or two neighbouring
villages, who have been less affected by Memi Angami culture than the others, and
of whose connection with the Semas there can be no doubt. The Semas trace their origin
to the south, and may certainly be connected through the two villages called “Swemi”
(one of which is still Sema though surrounded by Angamis) with the Khoiraos of Ngari
and so with a western origin;<a class="noteRef" id="n.xviii.2src" href="#n.xviii.2">13</a> while a connection <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xix">[<a href="#pb.xix">xix</a>]</span>is to be traced between the Sema with this western origin, and the Kacharis, Garos,
Lynngams and Bhois. The same probably applies to the Kezami-Angamis, though the infusion
of Angami blood and culture has swamped the Sema characteristics. It is to be noted
that Grierson classes the Khoirao language as Naga-Bodo, and Kacharis, while allowing
Nagas, or at any rate Kacha Nagas, to eat and sleep in the porches of their houses,
refuse to allow Kukis inside them at all, giving as their reason for this that the
Kacharis and the Nagas were originally descended from two brothers, whereas the Kuki
is an alien entirely. Possibly there may also be some connection between certain elements
of these Bodo tribes and the Manö and Southern Brè tribes of the Karens in Burma.
At the same time the Semas have absorbed numerous villages of Sangtams who trace their
origin to the south or south-east, the Southern Sangtams putting it ultimately in
Burma.
</p>
<p>From the north-east or east, as has been mentioned, some of the Konyaks derive their
origin. The Kalyo-Kengyu tribe, with perhaps Singpho affinities, trace their origin
to the north in so far as can be ascertained from the two or three villages on the
Ti-Ho river with which we are at present in contact. The Sangtam claim to a south-eastern
origin has been mentioned. The Northern Sangtams merely point to the south, but the
Southern Sangtams derive their origin from the Chindwin valley to the south-east of
them, and have a vague tradition that their tribe has become separated into two parts
of which one went apparently west, while remnants are believed to exist in the Chindwin
valley still. It seems likely that the part of the tribe that went westwards may be
represented to-day in the Lhota tribe, who have a similar if more definite tradition
about the splitting of their tribe into two parts, of which one stayed behind at the
time of migration. The Tamans, again, located round Tamanthi in the Chindwin valley
were at one time located in the hills to the east of them and returned to the valley,
leaving some of their fellow-tribesmen behind in the hills, and might possibly be
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xx">[<a href="#pb.xx">xx</a>]</span>connected with those same Southern Sangtams. In any case they trace their origin to
China across the Irawadi valley, and the descendants of part of their tribe are presumably
still somewhere represented among the Naga tribes.
</p>
<p>Of tribes with a southern origin, the Angami is the principal if not the only representative,
though here again we find strong indications of a mixed origin. To their present site
they came from the south-east, having come into their present country from the Tangkhul
country to the south of them, but unmistakable traces of terraced cultivation have
been found far to the south in the Lushai Hills, and it is possible that the immigrants,
who brought in this method of agriculture so peculiarly the attribute of the Angami
and, though in a less perfect form, of their Tangkhul neighbours, came from further
south still. While a spirit in the sky is regarded by Angamis as the ancestress of
them all, one legend of their origin, a legend apparently of the <i lang="njh">Kepepfüma</i> division of the tribe, derives the Memi Angamis from the daughter of a local god
at Mekrima (Maikel) impregnated by a cloud that came out of the south, and while a
common Angami tradition points to a village, in the Tangkhul country, known to them
as Piwhema, as the remotest place known to have been a fount of the Angami tribe,
a commoner legend still traces the two divisions of the Angami tribe, the <i lang="njh">Kepezoma</i> and the <i lang="njh">Kepepfüma</i>, to two brothers who emerged from the bowels of the earth at Mekrima just as the
ancestors of the Ao tribe emerged at “Six-Stones” on Chongliemdi Hill. In Kohima itself,
however, the biggest Angami village, one important clan, the Puchatsuma, came from
the west like the Khoiraos, while another clan claims to have come from the south-west
where the present country of the Kacha Nagas is. Part of the Chang tribe again claims
an origin from the south, though part admits to a common origin with the Aos from
Chongliemdi, perhaps due to the Ao blood incorporated with the Changs in the course
of their extension westwards. They would seem also to have Konyak, Kachin, or Singpho
affinities in some respects. But the Changs have a very <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxi">[<a href="#pb.xxi">xxi</a>]</span>clear and definite tradition of a complete change in their language, habits, dress
and everything else having taken place a few generations ago.
</p>
<p>Their immediate origin several tribes place in the south. The Rengmas thus migrated
from the Kezami-Angami country, throwing out the Naked Rengmas eastwards to Melomi,
and ultimately sending the bigger portion of the tribe westwards to the Mikir Hills.
Tangkhuls point to the south or to the east, Lhotas to the south with Rengmas and
Angamis, though there is one element in the Lhota country that points very definitely
to the snows of the Himalayas seen far to the north-west as the home of their ancestors.
All Naga tribes also have legends of clans descended from indigenous women out of
caves or wild men caught in the jungle and tamed, whose descendants are now no longer
distinguishable except by this tradition from the rest of the tribe. Thus there are
many Lhota clans usually described as descended from jungle “spirits”<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxi.1src" href="#n.xxi.1">14</a> captured by men of their tribe; the Phoms have a clan descended from a woman with
a child who emerged from a cave when they occupied the country; the Angamis of Kohima
have a clan descended from a far-distant ancestor “of the wood-cutting generation”
who was caught in the forest and tamed by one of the earliest Angami occupants of
Kohima village.
</p>
<p>Again, just as each tribe, almost, contains traditions which cannot be reconciled
with a homogeneous origin, so marked differences of type and physique are everywhere
traceable, not only as between different tribes, where they are in some cases most
pronounced, but as between individuals in the same tribe. Of course within the tribe
each village tends to form its own type, and after some experience of any tribe it
is possible to locate with some accuracy the villages of persons met by the shape
and appearance of their faces, but beyond this the physical types are different. The
Angami is tall and well proportioned, the Tengima and Memi sub-tribes in particular
having straight eyes and a <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxii">[<a href="#pb.xxii">xxii</a>]</span>nose sometimes even aquiline,<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxii.1src" href="#n.xxii.1">15</a> but in any case features that are far more regular than the very Mongolian-looking
Sema, whose tendency is most decidedly towards a flat nose and oblique eyes, combined
with a figure shorter and squatter than the Angamis. Another distinguishing mark of
the Angami among Naga tribes is the huge calves he has on his legs. This is so marked
that it finds a place in Sema folk-lore and is a proverbial characteristic of the
Angami. Yet one can see no reason in external circumstances for the development of
the calf of the Angami leg any more than that of any other Naga leg. The Angami’s
mountains are no steeper than any other Naga’s, nor does he descend and ascend them
any oftener. The Kukis have a similar calf development, but it is not combined as
a rule with the tall stature of the Angami. The Chang has the stature but not the
breadth nor the calf, being rather curiously built on very marked lines of his own—tall,
lean and narrow, though muscular enough.
</p>
<p>In colour again there is much variation, and though the height at which a village
is situated seems most definitely to affect the complexion of its occupants, it will
by no means entirely account for the variation in colour to be found both between
different tribes and again between different individuals within the tribes. Generally
speaking three distinct colour types may be traced, corresponding more or less to
the “straight-haired light brown race,” the “wavy-haired brown race” and the “crisp-haired
dark-brown race” into which Ratzel divides the races of Indonesia.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxii.2src" href="#n.xxii.2">16</a> Generally speaking the predominating colour among the Naga tribes is red. A really
dark skin, such as that of the Central Indian or Santali coolies who work on tea gardens,
is spoken of with contempt and aversion, and the Changs go so far as to say that the
only decent colour for a man is red, disliking white less than black, it is true,
but nevertheless regarding it as decidedly unpleasing and classifying Nagas only as
<i lang="njh">Mat-mei</i>, “real men,” of whom a red skin is an attribute. With this red or light brown <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxiii">[<a href="#pb.xxiii">xxiii</a>]</span>skin wavy hair is usual. In villages at a high altitude the skin is often so fair
that the pink of the blood can be seen in the cheeks and a blush is easily detected.
On the other hand, a fair and sallow complexion and straight hair are often to be
seen in all tribes and at all altitudes, being apparently independent of climate and
little affected by it, but much more prevalent among Manipuris and Kukis, in Ao Nagas
and in the Konyak tribes, than among other tribes. It is less common in Lhotas and
hardly to be seen at all among the Angamis, who are a very pronounced red, while among
the Semas, who are a darker brown than the Angamis though in some high villages very
fair (when washed), the sallow type is rarer than among Lhotas. Everywhere and in
all these tribes alike the children are apt to have rusty-coloured reddish hair, which
usually turns black<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxiii.1src" href="#n.xxiii.1">17</a> as they get older.
</p>
<p>Much rarer than the sallow type is that associated with a decidedly dark brown skin
and fuzzy hair suggesting the Negrito type.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxiii.2src" href="#n.xxiii.2">18</a> Individuals of this type may be met with occasionally in all tribes, but they are
nowhere very common, though perhaps least rare among Phoms, Konyaks and Aos. The fuzzy
hair is always a subject for derision, being regarded as most unsightly (straight
hair is by all looked on as the most becoming), and more so perhaps even than a dark
skin.
</p>
<p>Cephalic indices, as far as data are available, suggest a connection between Aos,
Manipuris and the Ahoms and perhaps some other sub-Himalayan tribes of Assam, which
might be due to a common infusion of Tai blood.
</p>
<p>One very marked line of cleavage between Naga tribes and their neighbours is to be
found in the methods of disposal of the dead. Burning is practised in this hill area
only by the Hinduized Manipuris to the south and by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxiv">[<a href="#pb.xxiv">xxiv</a>]</span>Singphos (or some of them)<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxiv.1src" href="#n.xxiv.1">19</a> to the north-east, but the other methods practised in disposing of the dead may be
roughly classified as burial, exposure and, for want of a better term, desiccation.
</p>
<p>Burial is practised by the Angami, Sema, Rengma, Lhota, Sangtam, Yachungr, Tangkhul
and Kacha Nagas and by the Kukis, but the burial is not in all cases absolute. Thus
the Kukis, in the case of rich or famous men, sometimes detach the head after decomposition
and place it in a cleft or hole in the side of a cliff where it could be got at only
with great difficulty. This practice is very rare, but certainly exists or existed
among some or all clans of Thado Kukis. Again, the Yachungr and some of the Southern
Sangtams bury their dead inside the house under the bed, and do not hesitate to disturb
the grave and dig out the bones of its last occupant to make room for a new one. The
Tangkhuls and some, at any rate, of the Naked Rengmas build small houses over their
graves with little ladders up to them for the ghost to inhabit, while the Lhotas,
Sangtams and Semas build thatched roofs over their graves, which perhaps suggests
that they formerly exposed the bodies in the miniature houses, since Aos who have
turned Christian, though they bury the body, build a thatched roof over the grave
like that which would be put over a body exposed on a platform if they followed the
custom of their unconverted fellow-tribesmen. North of the tribes mentioned exposure
on a platform is the rule, the body being in some cases smoked first. Among Aos rich
men are smoke-dried in their houses for two months. The platform usually consists
of a bamboo shelf thatched over like a house and covered in at the ends, though some
Konyaks use a wooden dug-out like a boat to contain the body, reminding one of the
Lhota practice of using a dug-out boat-shaped coffin. In the case, however, of the
tribes that practise exposure, the practice here again may be described as not absolute.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxv">[<a href="#pb.xxv">xxv</a>]</span>The Phoms and some Konyaks separate the head from the body, wrenching it off after
decomposition, the latter in some cases collecting the skulls in pots in a separate
place, and in others putting them out on stone platforms, while the Phoms put them
in niches in the cliffs. Both Phoms and some Konyaks bring the heads of deceased men
into their houses for a time (the Phoms for a year) and treat them while there with
some ceremony.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxv.1src" href="#n.xxv.1">20</a>
</p>
<p>The Chang tribe occupies a midway position both geographically and culturally between
the burying tribes and the exposing tribes, and practises both customs indiscriminately
and in accordance with the fancy of the individual, though exposure is believed to
be the newer form of treating the dead.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxv.2src" href="#n.xxv.2">21</a>
</p>
<p>To the north-east or east of the tribes already mentioned in this connection the Kalyo-Kengyu
tribe, or part of that tribe, practises what I can only describe as “desiccation”
of the dead. This custom of theirs has probably not before been placed on record.
The dead are smoked in their houses for two months over a fire and then the smoke-dried
body is retained as it is in a wooden coffin like a lidless box with a mat or bit
of thatch to cover it, either inside the house or just outside the mat-work walling
and immediately under the eaves at the point nearest to the hearth. Here it is kept
until the next sowing, when on an appointed day all those who have died since last
year’s sowing are brought out, their withered bodies broken up, and their bones picked
out and counted by a number of persons of both sexes, not fewer than a fixed minimum,
slightly less for a woman than a man. The bones of each corpse are placed in an earthen
pot and put at the back of the family granary, where they remain untouched till they
dissolve into dust or <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxvi">[<a href="#pb.xxvi">xxvi</a>]</span>till the granary rots and falls on them, while the broken bits of body together with
the coffin and its appurtenances are thrown away into the jungle, preferably over
a steep place near the edge of the village.
</p>
<p>When the implements and weapons of the tribes in the Naga Hills area are examined,
it appears that while some are of marked northern form, others are clearly connected
with Indonesian forms such as those in use among the Igorot of the Philippines, while
other patterns seem to show a very clear connection with the Kol-Mon-Annam types.
One type of northern origin is represented by the Kabui dancing dao and by a similar
dao intended for real use. The latter is very rare, but I have one specimen picked
up in a remote Kacha Naga village. It is precisely similar to a dao figured on page
190 of Major Butler’s <i>Sketch of Assam</i> (Smith, Elder &amp; Co., 1847) as a Bhutanese weapon. One kind of obsolete Lhota <i lang="njh">yanthang</i> is also a northern type.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxvi.1src" href="#n.xxvi.1">22</a> Both these kinds of Naga daos are remarkable for the way in which the iron of the
tang, which fastens the blade to the wooden handle, projects beyond the hilt into
a sharp point, the object of which seems to be to facilitate sticking the dao in the
ground by one’s side when sitting. The Garos use a similar type (and seem to be a
tribe of northern origin), but so do the Khasis, and it is possible that the type
may have some other source. In any case it is very marked and distinct from any kind
of dao in general use among Naga tribes. Of weapons suggesting relationship with Philippine
Island tribes there is a type of spear with ornamental barbs curving outwards from
the shaft, of which some Angami patterns closely resemble the Igorot spear, while
I have an old Kacha Naga spear with a head identical in shape with Igorot spear-heads.
This barbed type seems not to occur north of the Angami country, though the Aos may
at one time have used miniature imitations of such spears for money, and I have an
obsolete Konyak spear-head with straight barbs closely <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxvii">[<a href="#pb.xxvii">xxvii</a>]</span>resembling the straight-barbed Igorot type. Again, there is a rare Tangkhul dao with
a long projection behind resembling a common type of Igorot dao, while the stone hammer
used by all Naga smiths could scarcely be distinguished from a similar hammer from
the Philippines.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxvii.1src" href="#n.xxvii.1">23</a>
</p>
<p>With the Kol-Mon-Annam family the shouldered hoe (see Gurdon, <i>The Khasis</i>, p. 12) has been intimately associated. The Yachungr Naga hoe (<i>thoù</i>), obtained from a tribe hitherto almost entirely isolated from regular intercourse
with its neighbours, is almost identical with the miniature Khasi hoe used for hoeing
sweet potatoes, and is very similar to the Mikir hoe of the same type, while Mr. Peal
found shouldered hoes of a squarer type among some of the Konyak Nagas. Both these
types closely resemble some Battak hoes from Sumatra in the Leipzig Museum of Ethnology
(Ratzel, <i>op. cit.</i> I. p. 429) and are much the same shape as the Easter Island obsidian tanged blades.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxvii.2src" href="#n.xxvii.2">24</a>
</p>
<p>The question of the use of the bow is also to be considered. While the cross-bow is
the weapon of Singphos, and has been adopted from them apparently by the Naga tribes
of the north-east in direct or indirect communication with them, it is not in general
use among the Naga tribes.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxvii.3src" href="#n.xxvii.3">25</a> The simple bow is also not the natural weapon of a Naga. While the Kukis, before
they acquired guns, relied, like the Khasis, principally on the bow, the Naga rarely
uses it. The weapon was known to the Semas and is still employed by children as a
toy, and the Angamis have learnt the use of the pellet-bow, possibly from the Kukis,
and use it for <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxviii">[<a href="#pb.xxviii">xxviii</a>]</span>killing small birds, but as a serious weapon the bow is not used by either tribe;
and though the Semas believe that their ancestors used it, the Angamis appear never
to have done so, a fact which is interesting in view of the apparent absence or scarcity
of the bow in Borneo, Sumatra, and the Celebes (<i>vide</i> Ratzel’s Map, <i>op. cit.</i>, Vol. I. p. 145).
</p>
<p>Another point to be noticed is the use of the war drum. Sangtams, or rather Northern
Sangtams, Aos and the Konyak tribes, and probably the Yachungr and Chang tribes in
some degree, make enormous drums out of a whole tree hollowed through a narrow slit
in the top, and the ends carved usually with a mithan head and hornbill tail respectively.
This drum, when beaten by the young men who can line up to twenty or thirty or more
on each side with drumsticks like dumb-bells, will send a challenge, a pæan of victory,
or a dirge for the dead, for miles. But the Southern Nagas—Lhotas, Semas, South Sangtams,
Rengmas, Angamis etc.—do not make these drums at all.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxviii.1src" href="#n.xxviii.1">26</a>
</p>
<p>Diversity of origin on the part of the Naga tribes is suggested again by a number
of miscellaneous considerations. Most Nagas for instance reap with a reaping-hook,
but the Sema, like the Manö and Southern Brè (Karens) of Burma,<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxviii.2src" href="#n.xxviii.2">27</a> and like the Garos,<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxviii.3src" href="#n.xxviii.3">28</a> use their hand only, stripping the grain from the stalk straight into the basket,
a most painful method if it does save threshing.
</p>
<p>The use of terraced cultivation forms a very marked point of distinction between Naga
tribes. The various branches of the Angami tribe practise it in its most elaborate
form, followed closely by some Khoirao and Kacha Naga (Nzemi) villages very strongly
dominated by Angami culture, and followed in a quite appreciably less elaborate way
by Naked Rengmas, Tangkhuls and Maram Nagas. Other tribes do not use irrigated terraces
at all, if we except the Semas, among whom it has been deliberately introduced by
Government, and who still only practise this form of cultivation in <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxix">[<a href="#pb.xxix">xxix</a>]</span>a very small degree, save in a few villages who have adopted Angami culture in general.
At the same time, even among the Angamis, the Chakroma villages have no terraces.
It may be noted that the Angami system of terraces produces physical features exactly
like the system of the Bontoc Igorot in the Philippines.
</p>
<p>Among the tribes that jhum there is a marked difference in the method of sowing rice.
The more southern tribes—Angami, Lhota, Rengma, Sema—sow carefully, digging a little
hollow and dropping in the grain. The Aos and Changs, on the other hand, sow anyhow,
just chucking the seed down broadcast, and so do the Konyaks, in so far as they sow
rice at all. The amazing fact about the latter is that <i>taro</i>, not rice, is the staple crop, and in spite of excellent land for rice cultivation,
they only sow very little. They prefer <i>taro</i> (<i lang="la">Colocasia antiquorum</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxix.1src" href="#n.xxix.1">29</a>
</p>
<p>Closely associated with terraced cultivation is the custom of erecting megalithic
monuments. The erectors of the most numerous monoliths are the tribes practising terraced
cultivation, though Kacha Nagas (Lyengmei) and Kabuis put up little dolmens and occasional
monoliths, while the Lhotas and Rengmas proper, also having no terraced cultivation,
yet erect monoliths and alignments of monoliths in all their villages. North and east
of the two latter tribes, however, few Nagas seem to put up either, and the place
of stones in ceremonial is apparently taken by wooden and <span class="sans">Y</span>-shaped posts, used by Semas, Sangtams, Kalyo-Kengyu, Chang and possibly other tribes,
while the Ao uses round-topped posts or posts with a divided top.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxix.2src" href="#n.xxix.2">30</a> The Garos, it may be noticed, also use the <span class="sans">Y</span>-shaped post, while the similarity of both the <span class="sans">Y</span>-shaped Sema post and the round-topped Ao post respectively to the bifurcated and
round-topped stones left by the old Kachari kings at Dimapur is too close for mere
coincidence. It should be added that Mr. Mills tells us that Lhotas occasionally substitute
a <span class="sans">Y</span>-shaped post for a <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxx">[<a href="#pb.xxx">xxx</a>]</span>stone in their ceremonials where no stones suitable for erection can be found, while
there is a kindred of a clan in Yekhum village which migrated from further east and
which habitually erects posts, as it is not allowed to erect stones.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxx.1src" href="#n.xxx.1">31</a> In building, again, while the Angamis, Tangkhuls, Semas and other tribes south of
them build on the ground, the Aos and other tribes to the north build on a bamboo
platform or “machan.” The Lhota method is a sort of compromise, as when he builds
on a “machan” he covers the floor with earth.
</p>
<p>Even more than their customs the social constitution of several Naga tribes suggests
a diversity of origin. In more than one tribe we find traces of a dual division crossed
by a triple one, and indicating a division into three elements, either as three separate
groups or as two primary groups, one of which is again split making three. In addition
to these there are odd clans descended from “men caught in the jungle” and others,
as already mentioned. Thus among the Aos are found two linguistic groups, Chongli
and Mongsen, existing side by side in the same villages though retaining frequently
their different languages, and always, among the women, their differences of tattoo
and of hairdressing. The word for “mother” in the one of these two Ao languages is
<i lang="njo">ocha</i> (Chongli), in the other <i lang="njo">avu</i> (Mongsen). Across this dual division of the Aos we get a triple division into three
clans, Pongen, Langkam and Chami, which are nominally at any rate exogamous and which
run through both the linguistic groups, though the nomenclature varies, and though
the whole exogamous system is somewhat complicated by subdivision and by adoption
from one group to <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxi">[<a href="#pb.xxxi">xxxi</a>]</span>another. Of the three groups mentioned Pongen is generally recognized as <i lang="njh">doyen</i>, while the social position of Chami is usually regarded as decidedly inferior to
the other two. Again, among the Southern Konyak villages at any rate there seem to
be two linguistic and tattoo groups (one of which tattoos the face of the warrior
and the other the chest only) called <i lang="njh">Thendu</i> and <i lang="njh">Thenkoh</i>, while there are said to be also three social divisions running through both groups,
of which the first, called Ang,<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxi.1src" href="#n.xxxi.1">32</a> corresponds to the Ao “Pongen” and provides hereditary chiefs in those villages which
possess them, though in the case of the Konyak chief the heir to the chieftainship
has to be of Ang blood by both parents, contrary to the prevailing exogamous system.
In the Rengma tribe we have again two linguistic groups, as among the Aos, existing
side by side sometimes in the same village, and called Inseni-Kotsenu and Tseminyu
respectively. Of these two groups the latter apparently are again divided into two
parts distinguished by the use of different terms for “mother” (<i lang="njh">avyo</i> and <i lang="njh">apfsü</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxi.2src" href="#n.xxxi.2">33</a> The Angamis are again divided into two groups commonly known as Thevoma and Thekronoma
(or Cheroma) or Solhima, using the words <i lang="njh">azo</i> and <i lang="njh">apfu</i> respectively for “mother,” although the former term only is in use among the numerous
Chakrima sub-tribe of Angamis, though the distinction between the Thekronoma, called
by them Solhima, and the Thevoma is recognized. These two divisions of the Angamis
may be spoken of as <i lang="njh">Pezoma</i> and <i lang="njh">Pepfüma</i> respectively according to the terms they use for “mother.” The <i lang="njh">Pezoma</i> group appears to be also subdivided into Sachema and Thevoma, two divisions of more
or less equal status, though the former is actually the senior. Nowadays, however,
the Sachema group, which is very small indeed numerically as compared with Thevoma,
has been <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxii">[<a href="#pb.xxxii">xxxii</a>]</span>virtually lost sight of, and “Thevoma” includes the whole of the <i lang="njh">Pezoma</i>. It should be added that according to tradition the Thekrono division was originally
the elder, but was cheated of its birthright by the first ancestor of the Thevo division.
The word <i lang="njh">Solhima</i>, used ordinarily by a large part of the Angami tribe for the Thekronoma division,
means “alien” or “stranger.”<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxii.1src" href="#n.xxxii.1">34</a> In the Memi group of the Angamis we have again a third division, called Cherhechima
in some villages, which is regarded as socially inferior to such an extent that the
other Memi will not intermarry with it. This division seems also to be regarded as
the source of some unlucky emanation which has an evil influence on any who fall under
it, though the neighbouring Tengima, Dzunokehena and Kezami Angamis have no objection
at all to intermarrying with the Cherhechima. The Lhotas seem to be divided like the
Angami into two phratries using <i lang="njh">oyo</i> for “mother,” with a third using <i lang="njh">opfu</i>, and, as in the case of the Angamis, the use of the distinct terms does not extend
throughout the whole tribe, but seems to be dying out.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxii.2src" href="#n.xxxii.2">35</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxiii">[<a href="#pb.xxxiii">xxxiii</a>]</span></p>
<p>Turning to the polity of the village, different tribes have very different customs.
Among the Semas a system of hereditary chiefs exists, each chief having an almost
feudal position as lord of the manor of his village, a system which seems to have
obtained among the Kacharis, as the remnants of it are still perceptible among the
remote Kachari villages of the south-west of the Naga Hills. The Changs have a system
of chiefs very like that of the Semas, and both may be compared in this respect to
the Thado Kukis, though among the latter the system is more elaborately developed.
The Konyaks too have hereditary chiefs in the Thendu section of the tribe, though
not in the Thenkoh division, but among the Konyaks the priestly side of the chieftainship
seems more prominent than among the other Naga tribes with chiefs.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxiii.1src" href="#n.xxxiii.1">36</a> On the other hand, the Ao and Tangkhul villages are governed by bodies of elders
representing the principal kindreds in the village, while the Angami, Rengma and Lhota
and apparently Sangtam villages are run on lines of democracy, a democracy so extreme
in the case of the Angami that, in view of his peculiar independence of character,
it is difficult to comprehend how his villages held together at all before they were
subject to the British Government. The Angami has, however, hereditary priests, office
descending in the line of the first founder of the village in question.
</p>
<p>In the eschatology of the different tribes there is, on the one hand, a belief apparently
universally accepted which regards the souls of the dead as inhabiting butterflies
or other insects after death. Concurrently with this we find a belief in an existence
in a future world in which the shades of the dead go on living just as they did in
this world. Most tribes place this world underground and indicate <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxiv">[<a href="#pb.xxxiv">xxxiv</a>]</span>some mountain<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxiv.1src" href="#n.xxxiv.1">37</a>—usually one formed as it were in a succession of rises vaguely suggesting steps from
a distance—as the path by which this under-world is approached. The Angamis, however,
believe that the souls of the dead who have conformed to the best (Angami) standard
of life spend their future existence in the sky in the company of the ancestress or
creatrix of all life. Other tribes, though believing in the existence of a sky world,
or at any rate of sky spirits, do not locate the home of the dead there. Along with
these a third belief is also to be found, as among the Semas, according to which the
spirits of the good dead go to the East and those of the unsatisfactory dead to the
West.
</p>
<p>Among other points worth notice are the fact that lycanthropy practised by the Semas
and other tribes to the north of the Angami country is never resorted to by Angamis,
though they know of the existence in the belief and even believe in the common origin
of the tiger and man.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxiv.2src" href="#n.xxxiv.2">38</a> Similarly the Khasis seem to have heard the theory from the Garos, but do not claim
ever to practise it themselves.
</p>
<p>In folk-lore some stories seem common to nearly all tribes and to the Kacharis too,
while the story of the girl who comes out of an orange and the stories of fighting
stones and the belief that the human race is becoming gradually smaller and will so
continue till it is small enough to climb up a chili plant, are common both to Nagas
and to the Khasis.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxiv.3src" href="#n.xxxiv.3">39</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxv">[<a href="#pb.xxxv">xxxv</a>]</span>On the other hand, there seem to be certain groups of stories which are not common
to the Angamis in the south and to the Changs and their neighbours in the north.
</p>
<p>Linguistic considerations are notoriously dangerous in their application to ethnography,
but even here it is impossible to pass over without remark the very decided cleavage
between the vocabularies and numerals of the languages classified by Sir George Grierson
as Western and Central Naga, and the vocabularies and numerals of the Konyaks and
Changs to the north-east, though the Aos have words characteristic of both groups.
This north-eastern group seems in fact to approach quite appreciably nearer to the
Kuki and Bodo languages of the southern tribes than to the languages of the Central
Naga tribes in between the two.
</p>
<p>Emphasis has sometimes been laid upon an affection for old sites, or an aversion to
migration, as characteristic of Nagas, distinguishing them from the migratory Kuki,
who, like the Hill Kachari, moves his village by preference, whereas the Naga only
moves his under compulsion. This, however, as has already been pointed out, cannot
by any means be applied to all tribes at present designated Naga.
</p>
<p>A perhaps trivial point is the belief that neglect of washing causes illness, and
the concomitant habit of personal cleanliness which is so much more marked in the
Angami tribe than among its neighbours to the north, though the Lhota seems to have
it in a greater degree than the Rengma, Sema, or Ao; the Angami dwelling, on the other
hand, is frequently filthy as compared to those of the other tribes mentioned, principally
owing to his habit of keeping his cattle in the front room.
</p>
<p>Such are the more outstanding facts of the case, and it is almost superfluous to state
the more obvious conclusions to be drawn from them, that no Naga tribe is of pure
blood, but the area which they inhabit has been the scene of a series of immigrations
from north-east, north-west and south, and that the different stocks introduced in
this way <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxvi">[<a href="#pb.xxxvi">xxxvi</a>]</span>have entered into their composition.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxvi.1src" href="#n.xxxvi.1">40</a> Indeed, in view of the struggles that have taken place for the fertile plains of
Burma to the east and India to the west, it is inevitable that some elements of the
races worsted in these struggles should have been pushed up into the hills. In particular
the line of the Dikhu and the Ti-Ho rivers would seem to mark more or less the point
of contact between movements southward from the north and northward from the south,
roughly marking as it does, except indeed for the Ao tribe, the line south of which
dead are always buried,<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxvi.2src" href="#n.xxxvi.2">41</a> and also the marked cleavage between the languages of the Western Nagas and of the
North-eastern Nagas, the latter bearing more resemblance perhaps to those of the Kukis
in the south than to those of their immediate neighbours. The immigration of Singpho
elements from the north and Tai elements from the east are absolutely clear.
</p>
<p>The other conclusions I would suggest are some of them frankly speculative, but are
perhaps not at variance with current views on the history of Indonesia in general.
I should deduce a stage at which some race of Kol-Mon-Annam or Mon-Khmêr affinities
was in occupation, leaving traces of that occupation in certain implements, weapons
and perhaps in some folk-tales. I should describe the immigration from the north-west
or west as definitely Bodo in character, and ascribe to this origin the erection of
<span class="sans">Y</span>-shaped posts<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxvi.3src" href="#n.xxxvi.3">42</a> and the practice of reaping by hand, and the indications of the more recent existence
of a matrilineal system. Beyond this, whatever the Singphos and Kacharis may be, an
admixture of Tai blood from the east is beyond dispute. It is the nature of the immigration
from the south which is most intriguing. No one who has had much to <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxvii">[<a href="#pb.xxxvii">xxxvii</a>]</span>do with the Angamis could fail to perceive the difference of disposition and character
between them and the other Naga tribes, though it is very difficult to state in what
it actually consists, and it is certainly not so great as to constitute an entire
distinction between the Angamis and the rest of their fellow-Nagas. My own view is
that the Angamis contain a very much greater proportion of blood bequeathed by a mixed
body of immigrants from the south (some of them at any rate nearly related either
in blood or culture or both to the Igorot of the Philippine Islands), who already
consisted perhaps of two races of which the weaker and less numerous was a race of
settled habits and developed civilization, while the stronger was of more barbarous
but warlike type.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxvii.1src" href="#n.xxxvii.1">43</a> The inhabitants they found already in occupation would be either absorbed into one
of the two divisions of this mixed tribe or make a third class where they survived
in sufficient numbers, and to this source I would ascribe the social institutions
of the Western Naga tribes. I would ascribe the elaborate system of terracing to the
more civilized of the southern immigrants, and to these southern immigrants in general
the use of elaborate stone-work in building and the erection of stone monoliths and
perhaps the practice of burying their dead—the Angamis even bury the heads of their
enemies—and also perhaps the use of ultra-democratic institutions. If these deductions
be correct I should regard the Semas as having received chiefs from the more barbarous
of the southerners, and in the Lhotas I should see the result of a more intimate contact
of both southern elements with the tribe at present represented by the Sangtams, who
seem to have at one time occupied much more of the Naga Hills than they do now that
a large and still increasing proportion of their tribe has been absorbed by the more
virile Sema. The Khoiraos, Kacha Nagas, Tangkhuls and Marami have all been much more
strongly influenced by the culture <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxviii">[<a href="#pb.xxxviii">xxxviii</a>]</span>of these southern immigrants, than have the other tribes north of the Angami country,
and have accepted their culture to varying degrees.
</p>
<p>To return to the Lhotas, this tribe is divided into three phratries—the <i lang="njh">Tompyaktserre</i>, the <i lang="njh">Izumontserre</i> and the <i lang="njh">Mipongsandre</i>, meaning respectively “Forehead-clearing men,”<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxviii.1src" href="#n.xxxviii.1">44</a> “Scattered men” and “Fire-smoke-conquering men.” The expression “Forehead-clearing
men” I do not attempt to explain,<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxviii.2src" href="#n.xxxviii.2">45</a> but the phratry corresponds to the Angami <i lang="njh">Kepepfüma</i>, which I have taken to represent the weaker but more civilized section of the southern
immigrants. Among the Lhotas it is to be noticed that this phratry is the superior.
Among the Angamis it is the inferior, with the tradition, however, that it was once
the elder. Its women are addressed by their children as <i lang="njh">Apfü</i> (Angami) or <i lang="njh">Apfu</i> (Lhota). The Lhotas, however, have no terraced cultivation. The clans of the “Scattered-men”
phratry use <i lang="njh">oyo</i> for mother in some cases, <i lang="njh">opfu</i> in others, but <i lang="njh">oyo</i> predominating on the whole; but the name suggests a tribe of very different habits
to the community-loving Naga, and would better suit a people like the Kacharis or
Garos, living in small moving settlements and perpetually shifting from one place
to another, a few houses at a time. In the “Fire-smoke-conquering-men,” so called
from the villages they burnt in warfare, one may see the influence of the more barbarous
element of the (? southern) invaders, and the bulk of this phratry uses <i lang="njh">ayo</i> for “mother” like the <i lang="njh">Kepezoma</i> of the Angamis.<a class="noteRef" id="n.xxxviii.3src" href="#n.xxxviii.3">46</a>
</p>
<p>I therefore conclude that in most if not all Naga tribes traces are to be found of
the Mon-Khmêr and Bodo races, the Tai race, and a fourth race of southern origin akin
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xxxix">[<a href="#pb.xxxix">xxxix</a>]</span>some of the inhabitants of the Philippines and Borneo and other parts of Indonesia.
</p>
<p>For the history of this corner of the earth is yet to be written, and, if ever it
is done, it is to studies such as Mr. Mills has given us that future investigators
will turn, for the tribes themselves will have vanished past all recognition. Has
not the very <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> of Phiro hidden its grim fruit in the folds of its own bark, lest the village forget
that the days of the head-hunter are gone? Education and Litigation, doubtful apparitions,
are usurping his place; the old beliefs wither under the shrivelling touch of Civilization,
and the voice of the Missionary is heard in the land. The axe is laid to the root
of Igdrasil; the Jötunn are climbing into Asgerd.

<p class="first">The Lhota Nagas are a tribe numbering some twenty thousand souls which occupies a
piece of territory that may be roughly described as the drainage area of the Middle
and Lower Doyang and its tributaries, down to the point where it emerges into the
plains. Their land can show extremes of climate, from the high spurs of Wokha Hill,
where frost is not unknown, to the malarious foot-hills bordering on the plains, where
the heat radiated from the sandstone makes life almost unbearable in the hot weather.
They call themselves <i lang="njh">Kyŏn</i>, meaning simply “man,” the name Lhota, of which I have been unable to discover any
derivation, being that by which they are known to Government. They have long been
in contact with the Assamese. Many villages even possess grants of land in the plains
given by the Ahom Rajas, on the understanding apparently that the Lhotas in return
for the land would refrain from taking Assamese heads. This agreement was loyally
kept, and villages such as Khoro, who had no hostile Naga neighbours whom they could
raid, used to content themselves with waylaying and killing an occasional Mikir on
his way to or from market in the plains. There is no record of any fighting between
Lhotas and Assamese, save a raid in 1685 on some villages of the plains near the Doyang
<span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>by Nagas,<a class="noteRef" id="n2.1src" href="#n2.1">1</a> who were probably Lhotas: Akuk and Lakhuti claim to have met and defeated a force
of Burmese at the time of the Burmese invasion of Assam.<a class="noteRef" id="n2.2src" href="#n2.2">2</a> The first recorded meeting between a European and Lhotas is that of Lieut. H. Bigge
in 1841, who apparently did not like what little he saw of them. He calls them “a
sullen race,” and says that they “are alike filthy in their persons and habits, and
have a pompous mode of addressing one which might in some cases be interpreted as
insolent.”<a class="noteRef" id="n2.3src" href="#n2.3">3</a> Evidently the gallant officer found the contrast between the suave, sleek plainsman
and the easy-going, unwashen hillman rather startling. Captain Brodie, however, the
first Englishman to visit the Lhota at home, was more fortunate. He marched along
part of the Lakhuti range in 1844 and was given a most friendly reception.<a class="noteRef" id="n2.4src" href="#n2.4">4</a> In 1875 Captain Butler when in charge of a survey party was ambushed by the village
of Pangti and mortally wounded. The truth of this disaster is as follows: Captain
Butler arranged to march from Lakhuti to Pangti, and ordered the former village to
supply men to carry his baggage. Lakhuti, which had old scores to wipe off against
Pangti, decided to lay a trap for them, and sent a message asking them to attack the
head of the column, while promising that they themselves would throw down their loads
and attack the rear. Pangti fell into the snare and ambushed and speared Captain Butler.
Lakhuti did nothing, and of course got off scot free, while Pangti was burnt. Naturally
Pangti has never forgiven Lakhuti for this piece of treachery. In 1878 a stockade
was established at Wokha and all the <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>Ndrung villages,<a class="noteRef" id="n3.1src" href="#n3.1">5</a> <i>i.e.</i> those on the left bank of the Doyang, were annexed. The rest of the tribe was annexed
in 1889.

<h3 class="main"><i>Origin and Migration.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The problem of the ultimate origin and composition of the Naga tribes still awaits
solution. It will be sufficient if I give here the main Lhota traditions of their
origin and early migrations. These are various and mutually inconsistent. One, but
not the commonest, states that the Lhotas and plainsmen were once one people who migrated
from a place called Lengka somewhere north or north-west of the Naga Hills, the exact
site being unknown. They soon split up into two bodies, one of which became the plainsmen
of the Brahmaputra valley and the other the Nagas of the hills. The curious long-hafted
daos called <i lang="njh">yanthang</i>, a few of which are still kept as highly-prized heirlooms, are specially connected
with this tradition, and are said to have been given to the Nagas by their “brothers”
of the plains. Some at any rate are not of Naga manufacture. One which was shown me
at Okotso, for instance, was ornamented with brass bands. The usual tradition, however,
gives the Lhotas an autochthonous origin, and is almost identical with that told by
the Angamis of themselves. The story goes that three brothers, Limhachan, Izumontse
and Rankhanda, the ancestors of the three phratries of the tribe, came out of a hole
in the earth near the miraculous stone at Kezakenoma. If one load of rice were dried
on this stone it became two loads. Owing, however, to the indecent behaviour of a
man of the tribe the virtue went out of the stone,<a class="noteRef" id="n3.2src" href="#n3.2">6</a> and the Lhotas set out on <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>their migrations, taking with them a little piece of the stone, which is still preserved
at Pangti. Yet another tradition says that the common ancestors of the Lhotas, Southern
Sangtams, Semas and Rengmas, came from somewhere near Mao. The first to split off
were the Southern Sangtams, with whom the Lhotas claim close affinities.<a class="noteRef" id="n4.1src" href="#n4.1">7</a> It is said, for instance, that many generations ago a Lhota from Lungitang, knowing
that his forefather had left “brothers” south of the Tizu, somehow made his way through
the Sema country and brought back with him a Southern Sangtam, whose last descendant,
by name Ezanyimo, died at Wokha about ten years ago. Old men say that specimens of
the round brass ornaments (<i lang="njh">pyabi</i>) which Southern Sangtams wear on their “lengtas,” and of axe-shaped Sangtam daos,
were preserved as heirlooms in some Lhota houses to within living memory. From Mao
the tribe migrated slowly to Kohima, and from there, with the Angamis pressing them
in the rear, reached the neighbourhood of Lozema, where the Semas are said to have
split off. Thence they moved slowly on till they reached Themoketsa Hill, known to
the Lhotas as <i lang="njh">Honohoyanto</i> (fowl-throat-cutting-village). Here the mist begins to clear a little and most Lhotas
claim to trace their descent back through nine or ten generations to some ancestor
who lived at Honohoyanto. At this point the Rengmas split off and occupied their present
country, while the Lhotas pressed on, one body through Phiro and Saki to the Lower
Doyang, fighting the Angamis as they went, and another body to Wokha Hill, where a
huge village called Lungcham is said to have been founded a little to the north of
the present <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>site of Niroyo. So vast was the crowd of warriors that at feasts and “gennas” there
was never enough “madhu” to go round, though each man was only given one cock’s spurful
as his share. It was clear that they must split up or starve, so they began to move
off and found villages, sometimes ousting the Aos, who were once in possession of
almost the whole of the present Lhota country, and sometimes occupying vacant sites
to which they were led by various omens. A common story, told to account for the founding
of Lungsachung, Lotsü and several villages, runs as follows: A man had a sow which
wandered off one day and could not be found. He tracked it for miles, till he found
it lying under a big tree, where it had littered. He at once decided to found a new
village on the spot, and the tree where the sow had littered became the head-tree.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Ceremonies connected with the founding of a new village.</span> But the days of expansion are over now, and in many a village abandoned house sites
and “genna” stones all overgrown with jungle show how the tribe is shrinking. Yet
attempts are still made from time to time to reoccupy the sites of old villages wiped
out by malaria, and the ceremonies connected with the founding of a new village deserve
to be described. Having selected a site with a good water supply and a tree suitable
for a head-tree (<i lang="njh">mingetung</i>), the would-be founder<a class="noteRef" id="n5.1src" href="#n5.1">8</a> cuts a branch from a bush on the site. If the cut is a clean one and no leaves fall
the omen is good. If the branch is not cut through with one blow or leaves fall the
omen is bad. The omens being good he and his fellow-colonists select a man to be priest
(<i lang="njh">Puthi</i>) of the new village, and while still retaining the old village as their headquarters,
set to work to clear the jungle on the new site. Before doing so, however, the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> throws a cornelian bead into the spring which is to supply the new village with water,
and prays that the young men and maidens of the village may be strong. After the jungle
has been cut the founder makes <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>new fire with a fire-stick<a class="noteRef" id="n6.1src" href="#n6.1">9</a> (<i lang="njh">mi-hm</i>). The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> then spears a small boar, which must not be singed in the fire, and cuts the throat
of a cock, from the entrails of which he takes the omens. The pig is cut up, and the
<i lang="njh">Puthi</i> makes a little square of sticks on the ground. In the middle he puts an egg and on
each side thirty tiny pieces of pork. All eat the rest of the pig, the pot in which
the meat was boiled being turned upside down on the ground and left behind. The jungle
having been burnt and a small “morung” constructed, houses are built. When the village
is ready for occupation the colonists go to it from the old village in ceremonial
dress and fully armed, taking with them a branch stolen from the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> of the old village. This they stick in the ground under the head-tree of the new
village. To ensure a good water supply in their new home they must bring water in
a freshly-cut section of bamboo from the spring of the old village and pour it into
that of the new. If they are lucky enough to be able to steal them they also put under
their <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> and in their “morung” luck-stones (<i lang="njh">oha</i>) from the old village, thereby ensuring good fortune for their new home. About a
month later the ceremony of <i lang="njh">oyantsoa</i> (village-making) is performed. This will be described later in connection with the
institution of a new <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n6.2src" href="#n6.2">10</a>

<p class="first">In colour the Lhota varies from light to medium brown, the inhabitants of the low
ranges tending to be darker than those of high villages. The complexion even of the
fairest girls is sallow, and the almost rosy cheeks one sometimes sees among the Angamis,
and more rarely among the Semas, are unknown in the Lhota country. The hair is as
a rule <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>straight, though wavy and curly hair is often seen in the villages near the Ao border,
in which there is almost certainly a considerable admixture of Ao blood.<a class="noteRef" id="n7.1src" href="#n7.1">11</a> The hair of a Lhota child is brown, with a distinct rusty tinge, becoming black in
the adult. Young men usually pluck out the hairs of the chin with the nails of the
thumb and forefinger, but middle-aged and elderly men sometimes have considerable
beards, particularly near the plains, where types may occasionally be seen hardly
distinguishable in outward appearance from Sylhet Mahommedans. The eyes are brown
and slightly oblique in many individuals, the scantiness of the outer half of the
eyebrows accentuating the Mongolian appearance of the face. Men average about five
feet eight in height and women some three inches less. In build the Lhota is slight,
but strong and wiry, though he has not the enormous calf development of the Angami.
The hands and feet are small and well formed. The big toe is set rather far apart
from the others, and a Lhota talking will often pick up a stone in his toes and tap
the ground with it, just as a European might pick up a pencil in his fingers and fidget
with it.

<p>The style of hair-cutting resembles that of the Semas, Aos and other tribes. The back
and sides of the head are shaved all round up to a point level with the top of the
ears, the hair on the crown of the head being left long enough to reach to the top
of the shaven portion.<a class="noteRef" id="n7.2src" href="#n7.2">12</a> When asked why they have adopted this style of hair-cutting they say that their forefathers
used to wear their hair long, but took to cutting it in the present fashion because
it kept getting into their eyes and catching in the jungle. The custom obtaining in
the Southern Sangtam village of Phulangrr perhaps gives the clue to the real origin
of the fashion. There no man is allowed to shave the back and sides of his head till
he has killed an enemy in war. Till then he wears his hair cut more or less like a
European. Little Lhota girls have their heads <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>completely shaved till they are about seven years old, when the hair is allowed to
grow. Women wear their hair in an untidy bun on the nape of the neck, tied round with
a bunch of strings of their own hair.
</p>
<p>Baldness and grey hair are both uncommon and disliked, and old men sometimes hide
their scanty locks under a wig of black goat’s hair on a bamboo frame. All children
have the lobe of the ear pierced at the conclusion of the birth “genna.” At the first
<i lang="njh">Ramo</i><a class="noteRef" id="n8.1src" href="#n8.1">13</a> “genna” he attends a boy has a hole pierced in the upper part of the helix. This
is done with a pointed piece of bamboo, and no special ceremonies are attached to
the operation. Among the Southern Lhotas, and occasionally among the Northern, another
hole is pierced in the middle of the concha at the next <i lang="njh">Ramo</i>. The holes in the helix and concha are for the cotton wool with which the ear is
adorned and often become much distended in the case of elderly men.
</p>
<p>Circumcision is not practised and neither sex is tattooed.

<h3 class="main"><i>Dress.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Clothes.</span> The one garment never discarded by a man in public is the <i lang="njh">rive</i>, commonly spoken of in Naga-Assamese as “lengta.” This consists of a long narrow
piece of stout cloth ending in a broad flap. In putting it on the narrow piece is
wound once round the waist so that it joins at the back and forms a belt. It is then
brought through between the legs from the back, and up through the belt, the broad
flap being allowed to hang down in front. The result is a garment which is both serviceable
and entirely decent. The flap is either white or dark blue, with horizontal red stripes,
broad among the Northern Lhotas and narrow among the Southern. In the old days a dark
blue <i lang="njh">rive</i> could only be worn by a man who had done the head-taking “genna,” but this distinction
is being rapidly dropped. A boy’s first garment, assumed without any ceremonies when
about seven or eight years old, is the flap of one of his father’s discarded “lengtas”
hung from a bit of string tied round his waist. <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>The skirt (<i lang="njh">sürham</i>) worn by the women is about twenty-two inches deep. It is bound tightly round the
waist and the overlapping top corner tucked in in front of the left hip. The edge
which shows is often ornamented with iridescent beetle wings or bits of yellow orchid
stalk. Among the Northern Lhotas the <i lang="njh">sürham</i> is of dark blue cloth with narrow horizontal red stripes in threes, and a band of
paler blue embroidered with red three inches broad running round the middle of the
cloth. The skirts worn by Southern women have no red stripes, and the pale blue band
is broader and nearer the top of the cloth. When about five or six years old a little
girl puts on her first skirt (<i lang="njh">khondrosü</i>). This is about ten inches deep, white with a dark blue border and a little red embroidery
in the middle.
</p>
<p>When working in the fields, or in the hot weather even when lounging about at home,
a man usually wears nothing but his “lengta.” When visiting his friends, however,
or to sit about in the shade, or for a journey he always wears a body-cloth measuring
about four feet by five feet. Usually such a cloth is simply wrapped round the body
under the right armpit and over the left shoulder. But for any occupation such as
hunting, where both arms must be left free, and whenever a cloth is worn at any “genna,”
it is tied on to the body as follows: The cloth is flung over the back, and the two
top corners are brought round, one under the left arm and the other over the right
shoulder, and tied across the chest. The two bottom corners are then brought up outside
the cloth which is hanging over the back, and crossed and tied on the chest, one passing
over the left shoulder and the other under the right arm.
</p>
<p>The body-cloths are of various patterns and indicate the number of social “gennas”<a class="noteRef" id="n9.1src" href="#n9.1">14</a> performed by the wearer. The first is <i lang="njh">sütam</i>, a white cloth with broad dark blue horizontal stripes. This is worn by boys<a class="noteRef" id="n9.2src" href="#n9.2">15</a> and men who have <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>performed no social “gennas.” A man who has performed the first social “genna” may
wear the <i lang="njh">phangdhrap</i>. Among the Northern Lhotas this is a dark blue cloth, edged with broad stripes of
red with a broad strip of white cloth running across the middle of the cloth parallel
with the red stripes. Among the Southern Lhotas the red stripes are narrower and a
pale blue band near the top of the cloth takes the place of the white band. A Northern
Lhota who has performed both the first social “genna” and the head-taking “genna”
wears a cloth called <i lang="njh">chamthe</i>, which is exactly like the <i lang="njh">phangdhrap</i> of his section of the tribe, save that the median band is pale blue instead of white.
For the performance of the second social “genna” no cloth is awarded, but the Southern
Lhotas put on the <i lang="njh">ethasü</i> after performing the third social “genna.” This is a dark blue cloth edged top and
bottom with four red bands, the body of the cloth being ornamented with little squares
of red embroidery. Finally, a man who has completed the series of social “gennas”
by dragging a stone wears a handsome cloth called <i lang="njh">lungpensü</i>, which is dark blue with five bands of light blue about one inch broad, and three
very narrow lines of light blue at top and bottom<span class="corr" id="xd31e1546" title="Not in source">.</span> A man who has dragged a stone more than once has four or rarely even five narrow
lines at the top and bottom of his cloth, which is called <i lang="njh">eshamsü</i>. The <i lang="njh">rükhusü</i> (“enemy-frightening-cloth”) of the Southern Lhotas is rarely worn nowadays, and can
only be assumed by old warriors of note. It consists of a <i lang="njh">lungpensü</i> or <i lang="njh">eshamsü</i> with a broad median band of white cloth ornamented with highly conventionalized representations
of men drawn on cloth with black gum. These bands are made by Rengmas, never by Lhotas.
The <i lang="njh">rükhusü</i> of the Northern Lhotas is exactly similar to the cloth ordinarily worn by rich Aos,
and is dark blue with six very broad red stripes, set closely together at top and
bottom. The median band, which is always bought from the Aos, is about two and a half
inches broad, and ornamented with a conventional design representing human heads,
mithan horns and tigers.

the latter represents a row of warriors in full dress.
</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Like the men, the women usually leave the upper part of <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>the body bare, though filthy waistcoats are nowadays commonly worn by both men and
women in villages near the plains. When body-cloths are worn by women they are either
flung loosely round the body so that the top outer corner lies over the left shoulder,
or bound tightly under the armpits. Among the Northern Lhotas an unmarried girl usually
wears a plain dark blue cloth (<i lang="njh">muksü</i>). On the night of her marriage, however, when she goes to her husband’s house, she
puts on a very pretty cloth called <i lang="njh">loroesü</i>, dark blue, with big squares of narrow white and red lines, giving a sort of tartan
effect. When her husband has dragged a stone she may exchange her <i lang="njh">loroesü</i> either for a <i lang="njh">lungpensü</i>, which is almost exactly similar to his, or for a <i lang="njh">charaksü</i>, a cloth closely resembling <i lang="njh">loroesü</i>, but with the tartan squares outlined with much broader red lines. Among the Southern
Lhotas unmarried women and wives of men who have not yet dragged a stone wear a cloth
called <i lang="njh">süpang</i>, dark blue, with a broad light blue horizontal band near the top. When her husband
has dragged a stone a woman wears a <i lang="njh">lungpensü</i>.
</p>
<p>In wet weather men and women wear slung on their backs light rain-shields (<i lang="njh">phuchyo</i>) made of broad leaves carefully arranged between two layers of basket work, and strengthened
by an edging of thin split bamboo.

<h3 class="main"><i>Ornaments.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Apart from the finery in which he decks himself on ceremonial occasions, the well-to-do
Lhota usually wears certain ornaments on any occasion when he wishes to be well dressed.
In the holes in the helix and concha of his ear are tufts of cotton wool. Usually
these are quite small, but old men in villages near the Sema border often wear big
wing-shaped pads of cotton wool like those worn by their Sema neighbours<span class="corr" id="xd31e1622" title="Source: ,">.</span> Some small ornament, such as a little brass wire spiral, is worn in the lobe of the
ear, or in some villages an ornament formed of two or three porcupine quills, bound
with yellow orchid stalk on to a bit of cane boiled ebony black in pig’s fat. Like
Semas and Aos, <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>Lhotas wear above the elbow armlets (<i lang="njh">koro</i>) consisting of sections sawn from an elephant’s tusk. Formerly the sole supply came
from elephants killed locally. Now Angami traders buy ivory in Calcutta and Benares
and sell armlets ready sawn. Only old men may saw up a tusk. For a young man to do
so would be very unlucky. A man who cannot afford real ivory will sometimes wear an
armlet made of white wood smoothed and rounded to resemble the real article. Wristlets
(<i lang="njh">khekap</i>) of cowries sewn on cloth may be worn by anyone who has done the head-taking “genna.”<a class="noteRef" id="n12.1src" href="#n12.1">16</a> A man who has got first, second or third spear in at the killing of an enemy has
a little cross of cowries at the top of his wristlets. Those worn by the Northern
Lhotas are identical with the Sema type. They are bought from the Aos and are composed
of cowries filed down till they are very narrow and sewn close together on to a cloth
foundation. A red hair fringe (<i lang="njh">khezi</i>) is worn, on the wristlets, ordinarily short, but of long hair in the case of a warrior
of note. A man who has been in at the death of a tiger has little bunches of black
hair in his red fringe. The wristlets of the Southern Lhotas are of unfiled cowries
and the red hair fringe is rarely worn.
</p>
<p>The commonest form of necklace is one composed of four or five strings of black beads
made from the seeds of the wild plantain (<i lang="njh">eshe</i>). Sometimes they are worn loosely round the neck, and sometimes are in the form of
a tight necklet, the rows being kept in place by narrow pierced conch-shell supports.
These supports are sometimes bought from Angamis and sometimes prepared by the Lhotas
themselves, with the aid of a primitive but effective pump-drill, with a point made
from a piece of an old umbrella stay. To do the head-taking “genna” entitles a man
to wear a neck ornament of one or two pairs of wild boar’s tushes (<i lang="njh">soho</i>), with their bases bound with red cane, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>fastened with a square conch-shell button with a cornelian bead in the middle.
</p>
<p>The women’s ornaments are few and simple, and the magnificent strings of cornelian
beads worn by Ao and Sema women are rarely seen among the Lhotas. In the lobe of the
ear is some simple little ornament such as a bunch of the crest feathers of the kalij
pheasant bound round with red wool or yellow orchid stalk. Round the neck the usual
plantain seed necklace is worn, sometimes with a big conch-shell pendant (<i lang="njh">lakup</i>) in front. Above each elbow is a thick round pewter armlet (<i lang="njh">tiwo</i>), and on each wrist four or five small flat brass bracelets (<i lang="njh">rambam</i>). The armlets and bracelets are bought ready-made from the plains.

<p>A Northern Lhota with his two wives standing by the stone he has dragged. He is wearing
the cloth called <i>rükhusü</i>.
</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The full dress of the Lhota warrior closely resembles that of the Sema and Ao. Besides
the ornaments already mentioned, he wears on his head a wig (<i lang="njh">thongko</i>) either of the long hair from the neck and shoulders of the Himalayan black bear,
or of the fur of the arms of the male gibbon. In his wig he may wear three king-crow
feathers (<i lang="njh">yizememhi</i>) if he has done the head-taking “genna” once, or if he has done it more than once,
one hornbill tail feather (<i lang="njh">reching’mhi</i>) for each occasion. On his ears he hangs big pads of cotton wool, and sticks in the
lobe of his ear an ornament (<i lang="njh">tera</i>) of drongo and scarlet minivet feathers. If he has ever in his life raided enemies
working in the fields and carried off their property, he adds to the <i lang="njh">tera</i> little brass chains of Assamese, or very rarely Lhota, manufacture, which he loops
over his ears. Across his chest he wears one, or, if he has dragged a stone, two baldricks
(<i lang="njh">ritsen</i>), which are really glorified strings for supporting the “tail,” which in turn is
an elaboration of the “panji” basket. The Northern Lhotas wear baldricks bought from
the Semas, made of blue cloth embroidered in scarlet with dog’s hair, and edged with
a deep fringe of scarlet goat’s hair, with a line of yellow orchid stalk at the base
of the fringe. Those worn by the Southern Lhotas lack the fringe and are usually embroidered
with wool bought from the plains. The human hair “tails” are of two types, one (<i lang="njh">tsichap</i>) in which the hair falls straight from the little basket, and the other (<i lang="njh">tsongotsichap</i>) in which <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>the hair forms a deep fringe hanging from a piece of wood sticking out behind with
a slight upward curve. In the old days the hair for tails was obtained from women
killed in raids, but this source of supply being now closed, it is bought from any
woman who is willing to sell her tresses. I am told that one lady can produce two
good crops, but that the third crop is apt to be coarse. A warrior of note may wear
either on his chest or between his shoulders at the back an ornament called <i lang="njh">rüho</i> (enemy’s teeth). This consists of a flat piece of wood, about ten inches long and
five inches deep, covered with fine plaited work of red cane, with a border of cowries
and a fringe of scarlet goat’s hair at the ends and bottom. It is supposed to represent
the head of an enemy, the red cane being the tongue and palate, the cowries the teeth,
and the fringe of red hair the blood pouring out of the mouth. A man who has dragged
a stone may wear between his shoulders at the back the head of a Great Indian Hornbill,
a bird regarded by the Lhotas as symbolical of wealth. The true Lhota cowrie apron
(<i lang="njh">phuhorive</i>), which is now being rapidly ousted by the bigger one worn by Semas and Aos, is about
fourteen inches deep and twelve inches broad, the bottom two-thirds being covered
with closely set rows of cowries. A man who has been first, second, or third spear
at the killing of an enemy may have the plain cloth above the sheet of cowries ornamented
with little crosses of cowries. An old ceremonial apron preserved as an heirloom by
Ovungtheng of the Chorothui clan in Nungying village is possibly a specimen of the
original type of this garment. The tradition is that the apron in question, which
is a square of red cloth measuring ten inches long by eight inches broad, ornamented
with two little circles flanked by little stars of cowries, is an exact copy made
two generations ago of the original apron worn by the ancestor of the clan when he
came down from the sky.<a class="noteRef" id="n14.1src" href="#n14.1">17</a> The original was preserved till the time of Ovungtheng’s grandfather, when it was
destroyed in a fire. To within living memory small round brass plates (<i lang="njh">pyabi</i>) with a perforated boss in the centre were worn with cowrie <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>aprons. Exactly similar plates are worn by Changs and Southern Sangtams at the present
day. These plates were worn not only at dances and on ceremonial occasions, but also
at the ceremony of calling a sick man’s soul. For dances the Southern Lhotas wear
huge, bulging Angami leggings (<i lang="njh">chori</i>) of plaited red cane, with a pattern in yellow orchid stalk worked in them. The Northern
Lhotas wear a different type, which fits much more closely to the leg. These they
buy from the Aos, who in turn get them from the Changs, to whom they are sold by the
makers, the Northern Kalyo-Kengyu.

<h3 class="main"><i>Weapons.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Easily first in importance is the dao (<i lang="njh">lepok</i>), which is used for every variety of purpose. With it a Lhota can slay his enemy
or cut up a chicken, fell a forest tree or pare down the finest strip of cane, dig
a hole for a post or cut a thorn out of his foot. Villages near the plains usually
buy their daos from Assamese smiths. These weapons consist of a straight-edged blade
about twelve inches long, and four inches broad at the top, narrowing down to an inch
or less at the haft, which is fitted into a bamboo handle tightly bound round with
cane. Like all Naga daos the blade is ground on one side only, so that a perpendicular
stake can only be cut by a downward blow from the right or upward blow from the left.
The daos made by the Northern Lhotas are practically identical with those bought from
the Assamese. Those made by the Southern Lhotas are far heavier weapons. The blade
is about twelve inches long. At the top it is five inches broad, narrowing down to
one and a half inches at the haft. Both edge and back are slightly curved and the
junction of the edge and top is prolonged into a small beak.
</p>
<p>Two obsolete types of dao require mention. One is the axe-shaped dao called by the
Lhotas <i lang="njh">tsonak</i>, the use of which is now confined to the Southern Sangtams and other Trans-Tizu tribes.
Lhotas, however, state quite definitely that they formerly used these daos, and old
men say that when they were young they talked to old men who could <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>remember the days when a few were still preserved.<a class="noteRef" id="n16.1src" href="#n16.1">18</a> The other obsolete type is that known as <i lang="njh">yanthang</i>. These are supposed to have been brought from the north-west in the olden days, and
a number of them are still kept as heirlooms. They vary much in shape, but usually
have very long, narrow blades and always terminate in a long haft which must have
passed right through the wooden grip, as it does in the case of the Kabui dancing
dao. These daos are much treasured and are only produced at “gennas,” when they are
stuck upright, haft down, into the ground. The most famous is that of the hero Ramphan
which is preserved at Akuk.<a class="noteRef" id="n16.2src" href="#n16.2">19</a>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p016width" id="p016"><img src="images/p016.jpg" alt="Types of obsolete daos (Yanthang)&#xA;" width="420" height="720"><div class="figAnnotation p016width"><span class="figBottomLeft"><i>Drawing by J.&nbsp;H. Hutton</i>.]

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Types of obsolete daos (<i>Yanthang</i>)</span>
</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Daos are carried in a wooden holder (<i lang="njh">lechap</i>). This, like that of the Aos and Semas, consists of a solid block of wood some eight
inches long by two and a half inches broad, pierced from top to bottom by a slit about
six inches long and broad enough to admit the blade, but too narrow to let the handle
slip through. The holder is carried at the back attached to a loose belt (<i lang="njh">lechapsü</i>), which may be either dark blue or white, and in the case of a man who has done the
head-taking “genna” is embroidered with red.<a class="noteRef" id="n16.3src" href="#n16.3">20</a> The dao, of course, hangs blade down, but whereas all other tribes carry their daos
with edge to the left, the Lhota carries his with the edge to the right.
</p>
<p>Next in importance is the spear (<i lang="njh">otso</i>), which is always thrown, and never used for thrusting, the extreme effective range
being about thirty yards. The length of the whole weapon is usually about six feet
or rather more. The favourite wood for the shaft is “nahor” (<i lang="la">mesna ferrea</i>), but palm and other woods are also used. The shaft is <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>tightly fitted into a socket in the head without binding of any kind, and terminates
in a sharp, socketed butt. No counterpoise is used. Occasionally spears are made of
one piece of iron—head, shaft and butt. These are especially useful in tiger hunting,
where the animal is liable to bite off the shaft of any spear that wounds him. Among
the Northern Lhotas the blades are usually of the elongated lozenge type. They are
both bought from the Aos and made locally. The Southern Lhotas usually buy Rengma-made
blades of the Angami type, which are leaf-shaped with two short flanges at right-angles
to the mid-rib. The average length of the blade is about ten inches, but on some ceremonial
spears they may be seen up to two feet in length. A big blade with long barbs such
as Angamis sometimes carry (<i lang="njh">noringtso</i>) is occasionally used in Moilang and the neighbouring villages. There are several
kinds of decorated shaft. That of the ceremonial spear (<i lang="njh">phui</i>) carried by religious officials, such as the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> and <i lang="njh">Wokchungs</i>, is covered throughout almost the whole of its length with long black goat’s hair.
The doing of the head-taking “genna” entitles a man to carry a spear the shaft of
which is ornamented with scarlet goat’s hair, bound on with string and then clipped
short till it resembles very coarse velvet. If he has also been in at the death of
a tiger there will be one or two narrow bands of black hair inserted in the scarlet.
None of these red shafts are of Lhota manufacture. The northern section of the tribe
buy theirs from the Aos, who in turn get them from the Changs. One type, called <i lang="njh">kamang</i>, is only covered with red pile for about a foot of its length from the top. In the
other type (<i lang="njh">chovemo</i>) a space for the hand separates two long pieces of pile, the bottom one of which
terminates in a deep fringe of red hair. The Rengmas supply the Southern Lhotas with
their red shafts. One type, called <i lang="njh">tandhro</i>, resembles <i lang="njh">kamang</i>; another type is very like <i lang="njh">chovemo</i>, but has no fringe and is called <i lang="njh">rophutung</i>.
</p>
<p>The cross-bow (<i lang="njh">olo</i>) is still used for shooting birds and monkeys. The stock, made of hard wood, is about
twenty-seven inches long, with a groove to keep the arrow in place. <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>When strung the string, which is of twisted <i lang="njh">tchhütsang</i> bark, catches in a piece of notched bone inserted in the stock near the butt. Underneath
is a trigger, which on being pulled tips the string forward and releases it. The bow
itself, which is about five feet long and tapered off at the ends, is usually made
of bamboo. To be strung the bow has to be held on the ground with the foot with the
stock pointing upwards, and the string pulled up to the notch with both hands. An
arrow (<i lang="njh">lotsi</i>) is then placed in the groove. The arrows are merely pointed slips of bamboo about
a foot and a half long, with a little bit of “hair-brush palm” (<i lang="njh">shawo</i>) or bamboo leaf-sheath fixed in a slit at the end as a feather. They are carried
in a small bamboo quiver (<i lang="njh">lotsiphu</i>). The weapon is amazingly effective up to about eighty yards. Poison is never used.
</p>
<p>In the old days shields (<i lang="njh">otsung</i>) were always carried in war and are still used at tiger and leopard hunts. Usually
they are of strong bamboo twilled pattern matting, but hide shields (<i lang="njh">tsungkuk</i>) are also used. Sometimes a piece of buffalo skin is simply cut to the right shape
and dried in the sun, and sometimes a piece of bear skin is stretched over a bamboo
matting foundation. Shields are of two types. Those of the Northern Lhotas are about
four and a half feet long and twenty inches broad, with a rounded top and parallel
sides. Those of the Southern Lhotas are of about the same length, but have a square
top and are only some fourteen inches across at the bottom, broadening out to twenty
inches at the top. In battle shields were always carried held well away from the body,
for though they were not tough enough to turn a spear thrown directly at them, they
would check any spear which pierced them sufficiently to prevent it reaching the body.
</p>
<p>Stout cane war-helmets (<i lang="njh">kiven</i>), about six inches high in the crown, are still worn by the Southern Lhotas as a
protection for the head at tiger hunts, and also at dances, when they are often ornamented
with serow horns. Among the Northern Lhotas only a very few now exist, and these,
gorgeously ornamented, are only worn by <i>Puthis</i> and very senior warriors at the dance connected with the building <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>of a new “morung.” They are covered with a coarse cloth made of scarlet dog’s hair,
with long strings of the same material hanging down behind. On the covering are sown
pairs of boar’s tushes, each pair forming a circle, while two long flat pieces of
wild mithan horn, shaved down to the thickness of cardboard, fixed one on each side
complete the effect.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Writers in the past have, as a rule, either ignored or maligned the Lhota. Captain
Butler speaks of “the surly Lhota,” and Colonel Shakespear dismisses them as “uninteresting
people with dirty persons and villages.”<a class="noteRef" id="n19.1src" href="#n19.1">21</a> They are reserved and do not readily open their hearts to a stranger, but they are
not surly. Their sense of humour is well developed and they are always ready with
a laugh, but, like all Nagas, they hate being laughed at and believe that misfortune
or sickness is likely to fall upon anyone who is the object of derision. Though the
tribe contains a few habitual criminals they are, on the whole, very honest. Petty
theft is rare, and a man can leave his spear and cloth by the side of a village path
knowing that he will find his property untouched when he comes to pick it up on his
way home. In warfare they were probably no more cowardly than their neighbours, and
when hunting tigers and other dangerous game they show extraordinary pluck. For an
expedition they will supply carriers unequalled for steadiness and discipline by any
other tribe. The standard of morals varies in a curious way from village to village,
but the Lhota husband does not imitate the habitual unfaithfulness of the Ao, nor
does he, like the Sema, boast of his immoralities and decorate the grave of a deceased
Don Juan with a tally of his liaisons.
</p>
<p>Children as they grow up and marry leave their old parents to fend for themselves
in what seems to us rather a heartless way, but at a pinch they are usually ready
to help to support them. In this the Lhota stands midway between the <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>Konyak, who regards it as one of his chief duties in life to live with and help his
aged parents, and the Ao, who usually never thinks of supporting his old father or
mother, and even if he does so turns him out at last to end his days in a miserable
little hut, “lest he should defile the house by dying in it.” Towards animals the
Lhota, like all Nagas, adopts a curiously inconsistent attitude. At times he will
punish them cruelly as if expecting them to understand the difference between right
and wrong. For instance, I heard of a Lhota who climbed a tree after a badly wounded
monkey. The monkey clutched his hair, so he tore it loose and cut its hands off while
it was still alive—“as a punishment,” he said. At other times animals are treated
as if they were incapable of feeling pain. Frogs are often kept overnight with their
legs broken to prevent their getting away, and old men look back with regret to the
good old days when mithan at a sacrifice were beaten to death with sticks and the
valuable hair of goats and dogs was plucked from the living animals. A remarkable
trait in the Lhota character, wherein they differ from all other Nagas with whom I
am acquainted, is the extraordinary readiness with which they commit suicide. Often
the reason is trivial in the extreme. I have known a man hang himself because the
elders of his village fined him fifteen rupees—a sum he could well afford to pay.
Usually, however, a love affair is the cause, and cases of lovers, who for some reason
cannot marry, taking poison together are common. Little though he knows or cares of
the details of the life hereafter, the Lhota never doubts that there is such a life,
and lovers die professing their sure faith that they will be united beyond the grave.

and an old man who had no wife, were selected and these two had connection lying on
the stone. This <span class="pageNum" id="pb4n">[<a href="#pb4n">4</a>]</span>destroyed its miraculous properties. Possibly the idea was that the sexual act between
these old people was bound to be sterile and that this sterility should be communicated
to the highly prolific stone. The Rengmas have this story as well as the Lhotas. In
<i>The Angami Nagas</i> (pp. 19 and 362) I have recorded other accounts, both Rengma and Angami, of the manner
in which the stone was rendered unfruitful, and suggested that the methods aimed rather

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Position and defences.</span> With the exception of those situated on spurs running down from the great mass of
Wokha Hill, a Lhota village is invariably built on the very top of a ridge. The two
essentials of a site are that it must be easily defensible from a Naga point of view,
and near a spring. Unlike the Sema, the Lhota rarely calls a village after its founder.
An almost unique example is Mangya, which is said to have been founded by Mangyasang.
More usually some peculiarity of the site, or incident connected with the village,
gives it its name. Seleku is so called because many flying squirrels (<i lang="njh">selek</i>) were found when the site was cleared. Niroyo is the place of a plant with red berries
called <i lang="njh">niro</i>. Lungsa (<i lang="njh">olung</i> = stone, <i lang="njh">osa</i> = platform) is so called from a flat-topped rock near the eastern entrance of the
village. Okotso is said to mean the place where the pigs of Pangti were eaten by tigers
(<i lang="njh">woko</i> = pig, <i lang="njh">tso</i> = eat). Villages captured by the Lhotas from the Aos, such as Yimbang, Akuk, Mekula,
still retain their Ao names only slightly corrupted. Often a village retains the name
of its parent village, with Yanthamo (“new village”) added, <i>e.g.</i> Are Yanthamo. To defend his village the Lhota used neither masonry walls like the
Angami, nor hedges of living cane like the Konyak. The outer defence was a ditch cut
across the ridge in a conveniently narrow place. The bottom and edge of this were
studded with “panjis,” and it was crossed by a rough-hewn plank which was taken up
at night, <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>or in case of attack. The inner defence was a stout fence of sticks and bamboos, also
bristling with “panjis.” This was carried right round the village except in places
where the steepness of the ground gave adequate protection of itself. The door was
of bamboo, studded with “panjis.” A few sticks are still stuck up along the line of
the old fence every year at the <i lang="njh">Pikuchak</i> “genna,” and whenever the village performs the <i lang="njh">Oyantsoa</i> “genna.” Huge trees stand at the entrance to most Lhota villages. These were preserved
to form a wind-screen for the village and to provide convenient look-out posts for
sentries. War between Lhota villages was rare, and a powerful village surrounded by
friends would regard defences as unnecessary. Similarly nowadays Tuensang, the most
powerful village of the Changs, has no village fence. It is situated in the middle
of a circle of friendly Chang villages. The warriors of Tuensang emerge from the circle
to smite their foes, and then retire behind their friends again. Woe betide the friend
who is so remiss as to let a party of avenging enemies into the circle.
</p>
<p>A Lhota village is as a rule built along a ridge and has a main entrance at either
end, with smaller paths running down to the fields from the sides of the village,
and may contain anything from a dozen to 350 houses. The entrance to the World of
the Dead being on Wokha Hill, the spirits of the dead must leave the village in that
direction. The path leading towards Wokha Hill is accordingly known as <i lang="njh">etchhilan</i> (“dead man’s road”). It is a curious sight, flanked with offerings to the dead (<i lang="njh">sochipen</i>) and bamboo erections (<i lang="njh">nritangpeng</i>) showing the prowess in war and hunting of those recently deceased.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Communication.</span> From village to village there are narrow permanent paths along which men can only
go in single file. As far as possible they keep along the very top of the ranges,
for in the old days to use a path running under the shoulder of a hill would have
been to risk having a spear thrown at you from above. Where the rock is soft sandstone,
as it is near Tsori, toe-holes are cut in very steep ascents. Where the rock is hard
a notched pole helps the traveller up the bad places. <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>Small streams and ditches are bridged either by a single big tree or half a dozen
stout poles laid side by side. Across broader streams, such as the Chebi, cane bridges
are constructed. Long pieces of cane are stretched across from convenient trees on
either bank. Between these a <span class="sans">V</span>-shaped cradle of cane is constructed, on which are laid long bamboos to form a foot-way.
Long cane tie-ropes up and down stream prevent the bridge from swinging. The far-seeing
Lhota often plants young trees of a suitable kind near the bridge-head trees to provide
substitutes in case the old trees are washed away or die.

</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The village.</span> A village usually consists of one long street with a line of houses on each side
facing inwards. In the middle of the street are the “genna” stones standing opposite
the houses of their owners. The somewhat limited space is further crowded with old
fallen “genna” stones, graves and stacks of firewood. The villages are swarming with
pigs, dogs and cattle, and the state of the street in wet weather can be better imagined
than described, though some attempt is made to keep the actual doorways of the houses
clean by scraping away the filth with shovels (<i lang="njh">mirothenga</i>) made of the shoulder-blades of cattle or mithan. Sanitary arrangements are non-existent.
Pigs and dogs do the necessary scavenging in the jungle surrounding the village. In
every village one piece of jungle is strictly reserved for men and another for women.
Not all villages consist of one long street. At places such as Yekhum, where the ground
slopes awkwardly, the houses are built according to the lie of the land and are in
broken lines. Similarly at Pangti, which is on a fairly broad, level site, there are
several rather badly defined streets and the houses face in all directions.
</p>
<p>Unlike the Angamis, the Lhotas do not keep their rice in their houses but in little
thatched granaries (<i lang="njh">osung</i>) of bamboo which are raised on posts above the ground and stand in neat little groups
just outside the village. By this arrangement the food supply is generally saved even
if the village be burnt. It is absolutely forbidden to spread clothes to dry on the
roof of a granary. To do so would cause all the rice to go bad.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The “Morung.”</span> Every village, except the very small ones, is divided into two or more “khels” (<i lang="njh">yankho</i>). Sometimes, but by no means always, a little strip of open ground marks the division
between “khel” and “khel.” In some villages these “khels” mark the divisions of clans.
For instance, at Tsingaki there are two Kikung “khels” and one Nguli “khel.” But this
is not common. Usually a “khel” appears to be nothing more than a convenient division
of a village in which men of various clans live. Sometimes some feature of the site
gives the “khel” its name, e.g. <i lang="njh">Hayili</i> (“level”) khel in Akuk. Sometimes, as in the <i lang="njh">Wokhayankho</i> (“Wokha men’s khel”) in Pangti, the first inhabitants have given a name to the “khel.”
Usually a man lives and dies in the “khel” in which his forefathers lived and died
before him. But he is perfectly free to go to another “khel” if he wants to. In every
“khel” there is a common bachelors’ house or “morung” (<i lang="njh">champo</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="n24.1src" href="#n24.1">1</a> a building which plays an important part in Lhota life. In it no woman must set her
foot. At the <i lang="njh">champo</i> raids were planned and discussed, and to it all heads taken were first brought. It
is the sleeping-place of every Lhota boy from the time he first puts on his dao-holder
till he marries, this rule being only relaxed in the case of boys who are allowed
to remain at home and nurse an ailing and widowed mother, or when the <i lang="njh">champo</i> falls into such a state of disrepair that it is no longer habitable. In the latter
case boys are allowed to sleep in a separate room in their parents’ house. The <i lang="njh">champo</i> usually stands at the end of, and facing down, the village street. Though not to
be compared with the huge “morungs” of the Aos and Konyaks, it is the best architectural
effort of which the Lhota is capable. In length a typical <i lang="njh">champo</i> extends to forty feet, with a breadth of <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>fifteen feet at the front and twelve feet at the back. The roof-tree is low in the
middle, and curves up to gables at the front and back, that at the front being about
sixteen feet high and that at the back a foot or so lower. Two specially fine bamboos
are selected for the roof-tree. Part of the root is left on them and forms a horn-like
projection at each end of the roof-tree. To each horn is fixed a little cross-piece,
from which are hung tassel-like ornaments of reed-stem. The house is thatched with
either thatching grass or the leaf of a small palm called <i lang="njh">oko</i> (<i lang="la">Levistonia assamica</i>). The eaves reach almost to the ground and are brought forward in a half-circle in
front to form a sort of verandah roof. In the middle of the space covered by this
verandah roof stands the front post (<i lang="njh">humtse</i>), which is elaborately carved with conventional representations of mithan heads and
hornbills, and is carried through the roof up to the high gable. Behind it is another
carved post (<i lang="njh">humtse tachungo</i>). At the base of this post are the <i lang="njh">oha</i> stones on which the good fortune of the <i lang="njh">champo</i> depends, and to it used to be fastened a piece of skin from the first head taken
after a new <i lang="njh">champo</i> was built. This piece of skin is called <i lang="njh">humtse lama</i> (“post warmer”). It was believed that it brought strength to the post and luck to
the village. So strong was and is this belief, that as late as 1913 Tsingaki was punished
for buying a piece of a head to be used as <i lang="njh">humtse lama</i> from the independent Sema village of Satami.<a class="noteRef" id="n25.1src" href="#n25.1">2</a> At the back of the <i lang="njh">champo</i> is another carved post.

<p class="figureHead">A LHOTA MORUNG</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>The interior of a <i lang="njh">champo</i> is not attractive. It is dark, dirty, smoky, stuffy and full of fleas. Yet a Lhota
talks of his happy <i lang="njh">champo</i>-days much as an Englishman talks of his schooldays. The floor is sometimes levelled
earth and sometimes a bamboo platform raised about two feet above the ground on posts.
The walls are of bamboo. There is a door at each end and a passage about two feet
<span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>wide down the middle, in which fires are lit on cold nights, the smoke finding its
way out as best it can in the absence of chimneys or windows. Where the floor is of
bamboo four logs are laid down to form a square, the interior of which is filled in
with earth rammed firmly down. On this the fire is made. On either side of the passage
are cubicles with bamboo partitions, along the sides of which are sleeping benches
of rough-hewn planks, or bamboo “machans.”
</p>
<p>The time varies in different villages, but a <i lang="njh">champo</i> is generally rebuilt every nine years. Almost invariably it falls in ruins before
the time is up, but on no account must it be rebuilt till the due period has elapsed.
The ceremonies connected with the rebuilding are interesting. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> having announced that the rebuilding will take place in so many days, the boys of
the <i lang="njh">champo</i> collect bamboos, thatching grass, posts, tying-bark and whatever is needed. If a
new carved post is required the best carver in the village gets to work on it. Every
<i lang="njh">champo</i> has land belonging to it. With the rice from this land a pig and a big cow are bought.
These are killed on the day before the work of rebuilding is begun, and the carcases
kept in a little hut specially built by the side of the <i lang="njh">champo</i>. Next day is the first of five days’ <i lang="njh">emung</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n26.1src" href="#n26.1">3</a> which must be kept by the whole village. During these days no one may work in the
fields, or weave cloth or make pots or bring into the village meat from a tiger’s
kill. If a stranger enters the village he will probably be ill, and he cannot leave
it till the five days’ <i lang="njh">emung</i> are over. On this day the ceremonies begin. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> formally begins the breaking down of the old <i lang="njh">champo</i>, by pulling a piece of thatch off the roof and throwing it onto the ground. The <i>Puthi’s</i> attendant (<i lang="njh">Yenga</i>) then removes the <i lang="njh">oha</i> stones from in front of the <i lang="njh">humtse tachungo</i> and lays them down a little distance from the <i lang="njh">champo</i>. The roof is next carefully cut in two lengthways and laid on the ground in such
a way that the two halves lean up against one another and form <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>a shelter. Under this the boys of the <i lang="njh">champo</i> must sleep that night. The posts are pulled out and laid on the ground, the whole
building is dismantled and the site cleaned and re-levelled. The work of rebuilding
is then begun. This again the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> initiates by a formal act. Beginning with the <i lang="njh">humtse tachungo</i> he digs a little hole with the butt of his spear at the places where the three carved
posts are to be set up, and pours or spits a little “rohi madhu” into each hole. The
posts are then put up, new ones being substituted for any which may have decayed,
and the <i lang="njh">champo</i> is rebuilt as quickly as possible. Before leaving the work for the night the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> places a little ginger sprinkled with “madhu” on two crossed leaves at the foot of
the <i lang="njh">humtse tachungo</i> in order to keep away evil spirits, to whom ginger is particularly obnoxious. Thatching
alone is left till next day, which is a day of less work and more play. Everyone feasts
and puts on his best clothes, the men wearing full dancing dress. The first bunch
of thatch having been put in place by the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>, the braves of the village dance, some on the ground and some on the roof of the
“morung,” all singing the <i lang="njh">pangashari</i>, a slow chant in which the war-like deeds of the village in the past are recounted.
This song goes on all the time the thatch is being put on. A similar dance on the
roof is performed by the Konyaks of Namsang and Tamlu when a “morung” is rebuilt.
The thatching being finished the <i lang="njh">oha</i> stones are replaced by the <i lang="njh">Yenga</i> at the foot of the <i lang="njh">humtse tachungo</i>. All the men, led by the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>, then slowly dance in a rough column of fours formation round the village, ho-hoing
as they go. The chant is called <i lang="njh">yanungshari</i>. The carcases of the pig and cow are taken out of the little hut in which they have
been kept and cut up and distributed to all males, the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> receiving as his share half the head of the cow split longitudinally. A feature of
this, the second day of the ceremonies, is the dog-killing which takes place. Every
<i lang="njh">champo</i> in the village kills a small dog. That belonging to the <i lang="njh">champo</i> which is being rebuilt is carefully fattened up beforehand and tied up in front of
the <i>Puthi’s</i> house. When the time comes to kill this dog an admiring throng gathers round while
the oldest man of the “khel” sits <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>by the dog and gives it a bone to keep it quiet. He then covers it with his cloth.
Opposite to him stands the man reputed to be the finest warrior in the “khel,” and
the following dialogue takes place. Warrior: “Move away.” Old man: “Will you take
care?” Warrior: “I will take care.” Old man: “Do not hurt the dog.” Warrior: “I will
kill it quickly.” At these words the old man uncovers the dog and moves aside. The
warrior then attempts to split its skull exactly in two with one blow of his dao.
When the dog falls about a dozen bucks and boys dance round and round it chanting,
“He has killed it, he has killed it.” The head is cut off and brought to the <i lang="njh">champo</i>, where it is carefully examined to see if it has been well and truly split. If the
blow is found to have been a crooked one, the man who killed it is laughed at, told
he is no warrior, but a boaster and a wind-bag. The head is then thrown away by the
old man who attended at the killing.<a class="noteRef" id="n28.1src" href="#n28.1">4</a> In the evening a mock fight takes place between the young men and women of the village,
both married and unmarried. The women pretend to try to push their way into the <i lang="njh">champo</i>, while the young men keep them out. This mock fight is believed to increase the fertility
of the women who take part in it. On the third day the slow dance round the village
is repeated while the <i lang="njh">yanungshari</i> is again sung. Most of the day is spent in feasting and drinking. On the fourth day
the dance and chant are again repeated, but very few men put in an appearance, presumably
because most of them have bad headaches after two days’ heavy drinking. The chief
performers are a few hard-headed bucks and irrepressible small boys. On the fifth
day, the last <i lang="njh">emung</i> day, everyone rests.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Head-tree.</span> Perhaps the most conspicuous object in a Lhota village is the head-tree, <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>, generally a magnificent specimen of <i lang="njh">ningetung</i> (a tree of the Ficus family). It is usually situated on a mound well in the middle
of the village. Against its branches were leant the long bamboos from which were hung
the heads of enemies taken in war, and at its <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>roots are kept the mysterious <i lang="njh">oha</i> stones. These are counted and a fence is put round the tree whenever the <i lang="njh">oyantsoa</i> “genna” is performed. The fortune of the village is regarded as in a way dependent
on the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>. So sacred is it that in some villages it cannot be photographed. To break a twig
off it would entail the performance of the <i lang="njh">oyantsoa</i> “genna” (village renewing “genna”), which must also be performed if the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> dies or a branch falls. The place of the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> can never be changed. That at Lungla has been blown down. A small tree close by is
being used instead till a new <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> can be induced to grow on the old <span class="corr" id="xd31e2270" title="Source: sight">site</span>, a vain hope, as the old site is a mound of shale without so much as a blade of grass
on it. When a new village is founded a site is always selected on which there is a
tree suitable for use as a <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>. Under the new tree must be put a twig stolen from the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> of the parent village, though the parent village makes every effort to prevent this
theft, as it entails the performance of the <i lang="njh">oyantsoa</i> “genna” and is very likely to bring bad luck to the parent village. A curious belief
is prevalent in Phiro. Skulls which had fallen from their strings were often picked
up and jammed into interstices in the bole of the head-tree. At Phiro the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> is growing round and gradually covering these old skulls. This is regarded as a sign
that the days of head-hunting are gone, never to return.<a class="noteRef" id="n29.1src" href="#n29.1">5</a>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Water supply.</span> Springs issuing from the side of the hill below the village supply Lhotas with their
water. Sometimes it is drawn from a muddy pool of unappetizing greenish water, but
often there is a good flow into a basin dammed up with rough masonry. Small fish have
been put into the Niroyo basin, and are carefully preserved in order that they may
keep the water clear of scum. At almost all springs there is a small dam, and over
it a low fence so that women who draw water stand below and not in the supply from
which they draw. Unlike the Ao, the Lhota does not fancy water after the village have
washed their feet in it. When the <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>path from the fields does not happen to pass near a stream, water is often led to
it in bamboo pipes from a long distance in order that men coming up after the day’s
work may have a drink and a wash.

<h3 class="main"><i>The Lhota House.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Description.</span> A Lhota house varies in size from the wretched hovel of some old widow to the house
of a rich man which may measure thirty feet long by eighteen feet broad—a limit far
exceeded, however, by Aos, Semas and Angamis. To build a fine house as a show of wealth
a Lhota would regard as great waste of money, and a Lhota likes to waste nothing.
The walls are of bamboo and the roof of thatch (<i lang="njh">lishu</i>) or palm-leaf (<i lang="njh">oko</i>, <i lang="la">Levistonia assamica</i>). The front of all but the poorest houses is semicircular, with a door in the middle
of the semicircle. The roof of the front semicircular room (<i lang="njh">mpongki</i>) slopes up to the roof of the main building like the roof of the semicircular apse
of a church. The upper roof-tree of the main building is carried forward over the
roof of the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> with a slight upward slope, and is decorated with a little mock roof of thatch forming
a sort of flying gable. In the middle of the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> is a bamboo post, which is carried through the roof of the apse to meet the projecting
roof-tree of the main building. The interior of a Lhota house strikes a stranger as
very cramped and uncomfortable. Unless one is very careful one bumps one’s head at
every step. There is none of the spaciousness which one notices in the house of a
rich Sema or Ao. Where the ground is suitable and bamboos are plentiful there is a
machan (<i lang="njh">khantsung</i>) for sitting out at the back. Sometimes the whole floor of the house is simply levelled
earth, as in a Sema or Angami house. More usually, however, a step made of a short,
thick log leads up from the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> to the doorway of the main building, the floor of which is raised above the ground
on short posts and made of stout bamboo matting on a framework of whole bamboos, the
matting in turn being covered with a layer of beaten earth to keep the draught from
coming up from below. The floor of the sitting-out platform at the back is of bamboo
without <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>any covering of earth. The pattern of the floor of this platform varies according
to whether the owner of the house has or has not dragged a stone. In the former case
a mat of split bamboos interlaced in a simple chequer pattern is laid over a foundation
of whole bamboos laid at right angles to the back wall of the house. In the latter
case the place of the mat is taken by split bamboos laid at right angles to the bamboo
foundation.

<p class="figureHead">A LHOTA HOUSE</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>In a Lhota household each wife has a separate sleeping cubicle with a fireplace (<i lang="njh">nchü</i>) in the middle. A well-to-do Lhota usually possesses three wives. The main building
of his house therefore contains three sleeping cubicles and a little store-room (<i lang="njh">bhuritheng</i>) at the back. The cubicle nearest the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> is called <i lang="njh">lhuhrui</i> and is occupied by the third wife. The middle one is called <i lang="njh">olungo</i> and is the abode of the chief wife. The back cubicle is called <i lang="njh">tachungo</i> and is used by the second wife. Daughters sleep with their mother or, if she is dead,
with the step-mother they like best. Servants, if there be any, or a bridegroom working
for his bride in his father-in-law’s house sleep in the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>, either on mats on the floor or on the pounding bench. Guests sleep on mats on the
floor of the store-room or in one of the cubicles.
</p>
<p>A step up from the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> and a door close to the wall (usually the right-hand wall) lead into a narrow passage
running the whole length of the house onto the platform at the back. On the left,
assuming the passage to be on the right of the house, are the cubicles, the partitions
of which stretch about two-thirds across the house, and up to the beams (<i lang="njh">khokang</i>), the partitions between the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> and the first cubicle, and between the store-room and the sitting-out platform, going
right up to the roof. The roof is supported on centre-posts (<i lang="njh">tirhupu</i>), a bamboo one being placed in the middle of the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>, and a roughly-squared wooden one at each partition, and corner-posts (<i lang="njh">okinge</i>) at the corners of the main building. Small posts in the walls help to support rafters
(<i lang="njh">khirong</i>). There is no chimney and the smoke finds its way out as best it can. The cubicles
are lighted only by their fires.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Construction.</span> When a Lhota builds a house he sets about it as follows. After the harvest is in
he chooses a site and touches the ground with his hand. Then he goes off to a dreamer
(<i lang="njh">hahang</i>), of whom there are two or three in every village, with a small present of food,
and asks him to dream that night and tell him in the morning if the site will be a
lucky one. Dreams of springs, gourds, cucumbers, leaves, daos and spears, among other
things, are good. To dream of digging, hair dyed scarlet and black thread forebodes
death. If the dreamer has a vision of frogs, crabs, or tortoises the man who builds
a house on the site which is being tested will be ill. If the dreamer reports visions
of good omen (and he generally does, for a seer of evil dreams does not keep his clients
long) the builder of the house calls his friends and relations together and work is
begun. The positions of the corner-posts are first marked out, the length and breadth
and diagonals being carefully measured. These posts are then put in, and after them
the centre-posts and side-posts of the walls. If the house is to have a raised bamboo
floor this is now made. Long bamboos or poles are then laid along the top of the side-posts
of the walls, which are notched to receive them, and tied in position with <i lang="njh">yhandra</i> bark. This bark is taken from the tree in long strips and dried in the sun for some
days. The strips are twisted and wetted when required for use. On the top of the skeleton
wall thus made are laid and tied bamboo cross-beams in pairs, each pair enclosing
one of the wooden centre-posts, to which it is firmly tied. There is no cross-beam
across the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>. The tops of the wooden centre-posts are then notched and a bamboo roof-tree (<i lang="njh">mhongki</i>) is put in place. This stretches out far in front of the main building. At its junction
with the centre-post standing between the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> and the first cubicle it is broken half through and carefully bent down, for the
projecting end of it will eventually form the centre rafter of the semicircular roof
of the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>. The rafters (<i lang="njh">khirong</i>) are then put on. To enable them to be tied they must necessarily project and form
a series of forks along the top of the roof-tree. On these forks is laid another roof-tree,
which is not bent down like the first, but projects right <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>out above the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> and is supported by the bamboo centre-post. Further to strengthen the rafters and
prevent them lifting in a high wind, two other roof-trees are placed in position in
the side forks on either side of the main roof-trees. These side roof-trees project
beyond the main building and are bent down like the under one to form rafters for
the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>. Partitions inside the house are now built and purlins (<i lang="njh">sütesüyo</i>) are put on, all being so bent as to form purlins for the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>. The bottom pair of purlins are so made that the projecting ends can be bent to meet
and be tied. This gives the outline of the semicircular apse of the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>. Posts are put in to which the bottom pair of purlins are tied in position. The projecting
ends of roof-trees and other purlins are then brought down and tied to it, and the
framework of the house is complete. Chequer pattern bamboo walls are quickly put up
and the thatching is begun. Sections of thatching about six feet long are prepared
as follows by men on the ground, and handed up to men on the roof, who put them in
position. Thatch is carefully bent double over a thin bamboo about six feet long,
care being taken to see that it forms a fringe without gaps. Then to keep the thatch
in place two more bamboos of the same size and length are placed on either side of
it about five inches below the first bamboo. These are firmly tied together through
the thatch with strips of bamboo. With palm leaves the top bamboo is omitted, a fringe
of overlapping palm leaves being held in place by the two thin bamboos, one on either
side. These fringes are then tied on to the rafters and purlins, beginning at the
eaves and working upwards so that each fringe overlaps the one below it. Finally,
thatch is doubled over the upper roof-tree and fastened down with two long bamboo
wind-ties. This last layer of thatch extends to the end of the upper roof-tree, forming
a sort of flying gable where it projects over the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>. Light bamboo doors are then made. These are not attached to the door-posts in any
way and can be lifted and laid aside. Two crossed bamboos are attached to the door
by a loop of bark string and jammed behind the door-posts to keep it in place. A man
who has <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>dragged a stone more than once can decorate his roof with crossed bamboos representing
mithan horns, but this is considered rather a snobbish display of wealth and the privilege
is rarely taken advantage of. In some Southern Lhota villages the <i>Puthis’</i> houses have the roof decorated with crossed bamboos of which the ends are split and
splayed apart. This is a conventional representation of human hands, and the right
to have the roofs of their houses ornamented in this way was formerly confined to
men who had succeeded in bringing the fingers or toes of an enemy home from a raid.
Rich Aos decorate their roofs in a similar way.
</p>
<p>Before such a house can be occupied lurking evil spirits must of course be dealt with.
For this the oldest of the men who helped to build the house is called in to act as
<i lang="njh">tsandhramo epang</i> (“driver away of evil spirits”). Having mixed ginger and “rohi madhu” in a new “chunga,”
he sprinkles the inside of the house with the concoction and says, “We are going to
stay here. You go away.” He then throws away the “chunga,” which must never be used
for anything else. The old man then marks out the places for the hearth-stones, which
the owner places in position. The owner then either lights a fire with a fire-stick
or fetches fire from another house—any house will do. Matches are never used by Lhotas
for ceremonial fire-making. A meal is now cooked and partaken of by the owner and
his household and friends and the old man, who then takes the omens. He holds in his
hands a small chicken called <i lang="njh">kichakro</i>, which each member of the household touches with his or her left hand. This he strangles
and disembowels, taking the omens from the entrails. After which he cuts it up and,
holding eight pieces of meat in each hand, takes his seat with the male members of
the household on his right and the female members on his left, and swings his hands
backwards and forwards four times with an underhand bowling action, counting the number
of swings aloud. The chicken is the old man’s fee, and he takes it away, returning
in the morning to report whether he has had dreams of good or evil omen. A man may
not act as <i lang="njh">tsandhramo epang</i> for more than one <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>household on the same day. The only restriction placed on occupants of a new house
is one forbidding them to allow men from another village to enter the house till the
earth which has been put on the bamboo floor is dry. A house of which the floor is
mother earth may be entered by strangers as soon as the above ceremony has been performed.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The contents of the house.</span> In the front room of the Lhota house are kept heavy articles, such as the pounding
table (<i lang="njh">tsampo</i>), liquor vat (<i lang="njh">ochen</i>), and pigs’ feeding trough (<i lang="njh">wokochakpfu</i>), the last being merely a log split in two and roughly hollowed. The pounding table
is hewn from one piece of wood. In the top, which is slightly concave, one, two or
three holes about six inches in diameter are burnt. In these the rice is pounded with
heavy poles—an arduous occupation at which the daughters of the house spend a good
deal of their time. The liquor vat consists of a log hollowed out from one end. Trees
for this are carefully chosen, but a very large proportion of vats split or spring
a leak before they are finished. On the wall of the front room are hung the feet of
game which the owner of the house has killed. Spears are always kept stuck in the
ground in front of the big wooden post. Along the sides of the inner cubicles are
the small plank beds of the household. According to Lhota ideas a single thickness
of cloth spread on the bed makes quite a soft enough mattress. Round the fire are
little wooden stools about six inches high cut from one piece of wood. Floor space
being limited in a Lhota house, most things are kept on rough bamboo shelves (<i lang="njh">theka</i>) fixed to the beams of the house. Here are kept bundles of salt wrapped in leaves,
cooking pots, baskets of yeast, traps, carrying baskets, and a thousand and one things.
For cooking rice and meat Naga-made earthen pots are generally used, but for heating
“madhu” shallow iron pots from the plains are popular. In them the brew can be stirred
easily and without risk of an upset. Lhota houses contain very few drinking cups.
Villages on the Sema border obtain bamboo cups from their neighbours, and nowadays
cheap German enamel and aluminium ware are often used. But the true Lhota cup is a
folded plantain leaf. It is really an astonishing sight to <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>watch one’s hostess fold a piece of plantain leaf into a cup with one hand, while
she talks hard to one guest and pours out “madhu” for another, either from a gourd
or, more commonly, an old beer bottle. The usual type of dish is a shallow wooden
one, with no legs, called <i lang="njh">opyi</i>, many of which are made in Lungsa. Some households also use a wooden dish on a raised
stand, rather like a dessert dish, called <i lang="njh">pyikhyu</i>. In the bamboo matting of the walls are stuck daos, bamboo spoons and many odds and
ends. The hollow bamboos in which water is carried up from the spring are kept leaning
against the walls. Over the fire is suspended a bamboo platform about five feet square.
This prevents sparks flying up to the roof and also serves as a convenient place on
which to dry meat, and keep such pots and spoons and things as are in continual use.
The little store-room at the back is comparatively free from smoke and in it ceremonial
ornaments and spare cloths are hung.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Spinning.</span> Spinning, like dyeing and weaving, is performed entirely by women, and every Lhota
woman is expected to weave the cloths of her husband and family. The thread is spun
as follows. Home-grown cotton—the Lhotas are great cotton-growers—is cleaned of its
seeds by being rolled on a flat stone with a small stick, used like a rolling-pin.
This cleaning is a tedious process which generally falls to the lot of the old widows
of the village, who eke out a scanty livelihood thereby. The cleaned cotton after
being fluffed out by being flicked with the string of an instrument (<i lang="njh">loko</i>) like a miniature bow is then gently rolled between the hands into “sausages” about
nine inches long, after which it is ready to be spun into thread. The Lhota spindle
(<i lang="njh">humtsi</i>) is a very primitive affair and is similar to that of the Aos, Semas and Angamis.
It consists of a thin penholder-shaped stick of hard wood about eight inches long,
tapering to a fine point at the top, and about the thickness of a pencil at the thickest
point near the bottom. Just above the <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>thickest point is fixed a whorl made of soft black stone. This is made by rubbing
on other stones till it is flat and round a piece of the soft stone used for the purpose.
To make the hole in the middle a man holds it between his toes and twiddles a spear
on it between his hands till the iron butt of the spear goes through. For spinning
the tip of the spindle is wetted with the tongue. The spindle is then spun clock-wise
with the right hand against the outside of the right thigh, the base of the spindle
being kept in bounds by a conveniently cup-shaped piece of broken pottery covered
with a bit of rag. The “sausage” of cotton is held in the left hand, and the end of
it laid against the wetted tip of the spindle till it catches and the thread (<i lang="njh">oying</i>) begins to form. When about a yard has been spun it is unwound from the tip of the
spindle and rewound just above the stone whorl. The spindle is then worked as before,
the cotton being held in the left hand, and thread accumulates above the whorl till
the spindle becomes full, when it is wound off onto a wooden frame (<i lang="njh">kukung</i>), shaped like a double <span class="sans">T</span>, and another spindleful is begun, and so on till the <i lang="njh">kukung</i> is full. The thread is next hardened by being steeped for about five minutes in hot
rice-water, after which the skeins (<i lang="njh">yingsak</i>) are strung on a stick (<i lang="njh">phutsi</i>) to dry. It is forbidden for a man to eat the boiled rice from which this rice-water
has been taken. When the thread is required for weaving it is wound into a ball (<i lang="njh">yingtso</i>), the woman who is sitting winding keeping the skein stretched round her knees.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dyeing.</span> Three colours, red, dark blue and light blue, are used by the Lhotas. Red thread
is generally bought either from a shop or from an Ao village, for red dyeing is considered
a risky occupation likely to bring on dysentery, and therefore only suitable for old
women, who are of no value to the community. The industry, however, is carried on
in a few Lhota villages, such as Changsü and Okotso. To make red dye the root of <i lang="la">Rubia sikkimensis</i> (<i lang="njh">karung</i>) is pounded up, and another leaf (<i lang="njh">’ntawo</i>) is pounded and added. The mixture is then boiled with water, and the thread put
in while the water is boiling. The pot is then lifted off the fire and <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>allowed to stand for three days, when the thread is taken out and dried.
</p>
<p>Dark blue dye is made from the leaves of <i lang="la">Strobilanthes flaccidi-folius</i> (<i lang="njh">tchemo</i>), pounded up and boiled with water. The thread is steeped in the mixture for half
an hour and is then dried. This gives a colour like navy blue. To make light blue
the leaves which have been already boiled and used for making dark blue dye are drained
and dried and kept for a year. They are then broken up fine and mixed with cold water
and the white ash of burnt bark, and put to stand till next day, when the thread is
put in and left there for a day, or for two days if the dye is weak. It is then taken
out and dried.
</p>
<p>Dyeing is exclusively performed by women, who when they are so occupied must refrain
from sexual intercourse and must not eat beef, goat’s flesh, dog’s flesh, dried fish,
or that horrible vegetable known in Naga-Assamese as “stinking dal” (<i lang="njh">nyingtyingtsing</i>), in fact any food with a strong smell. If any man were to dye a piece of thread
he would never again have any luck in fishing or hunting. No one but the dyer must
look on while thread is being dyed or the colour will be patchy and bad.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Weaving.</span> Like the Semas and Aos, the Lhotas use a simple single-heddle tension loom (<i lang="njh">tsirochunglung</i>) which is set up and operated as follows. A beam (<i lang="njh">tsikam</i>) of bamboo about three feet long is securely fastened to the wall of the house or
any other suitable firm support in a horizontal position and at a height of about
two feet from the ground. On this are slipped two loops (<i lang="njh">tsisü</i>) of bark string, in which is put the other bar (<i lang="njh">ncho</i>) of the loom. The loops are set at a distance apart equal to the breadth of the piece
of cloth to be woven. The lower bar (<i lang="njh">ncho</i>) is notched at either end, to enable the weaving belt (<i lang="njh">ephi</i>) to be attached to it. This belt is of woven cane or bamboo and is worn by the operator
in the small of her back. By it, as she sits in front of the loom, she can keep the
necessary tension on the warp. Both the beams being in position and a strain having
been taken on the <i lang="njh">tsisü</i>, each <i lang="njh">tsisü</i> is crossed by the lower string being pulled up and the upper down and a thin stick
of bamboo <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>(<i lang="njh">yingyi</i>) is put in position. This is naturally held firmly in place by the downward pressure
of the lower strings and the upward pressure of the upper. Then, working towards the
weaver, the lease-rod (<i lang="njh">chunglung</i>) is put in close to the <i lang="njh">yingyi</i> without crossing the strings. Below the lease-rod the sword (<i lang="njh">tsitam</i>) is inserted, the strings being crossed as in the case of the <i lang="njh">yingyi</i>. The twine which is to form the heddle-loops (<i lang="njh">ena</i>) is now tied loosely onto the left end of the sword and laid along it. This twine
is sometimes thick cotton thread and is sometimes made from the twisted bark of a
creeper called <i lang="njh">enazü</i> (<i lang="la">Pineraria Thungbergiana</i>). Two balls of thread are then taken and their loose ends twisted together and joined.
One ball is held in the lap of the weaver while the other is passed over the <i lang="njh">ncho</i>, under the <i lang="njh">tsitam</i> and the <i lang="njh">ena</i> which is lying along it, over the <i lang="njh">chunglung</i> and under and then round over and under the <i lang="njh">yingyi</i> and then over the <i lang="njh">tsikam</i>, from whence it is brought straight back to the weaver under the loom. The second
ball is then passed under the <i lang="njh">ncho</i> and over the <i lang="njh">ena</i> and under the <i lang="njh">tsitam</i> and <i lang="njh">chunglung</i>, and under and back over and under the <i lang="njh">yingyi</i> and over the <i lang="njh">tsikam</i>, and is brought back to the weaver under the loom. The process is repeated till all
the warp (<i lang="njh">elomo</i>) has been set. The result is that the <i lang="njh">ena</i> forms a series of heddle-loops and the <i lang="njh">yingyi</i> (the object of which is to shorten the upper side of the shed made by the lease-rod)
is entirely encircled by each warp. Unless the loom be a very small one the weaver
cannot reach the <i lang="njh">tsikam</i>. She therefore generally has an assistant, who can be a man, to pass the warp thread
over and under the <i lang="njh">tsikam</i>. The two ends of the warp thread, when all has been set are turned back across the
warp and woven into the material. The shuttle (<i lang="njh">yingshü</i>), which is simply a thin piece of bamboo, is filled from the ball by being spun against
the right thigh. This process and that of setting the warp are the only two in which
a man may take part. Before weaving can begin the <i lang="njh">tsitam</i>, a flat piece of hard wood, is turned on edge and the heddle (<i lang="njh">natyung</i>) is slipped in alongside it so as to take up the heddle-loops formed by the <i lang="njh">ena</i>. The <i lang="njh">tsitam</i> is then removed. The object of substituting <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>the sword for the heddle while the warp is being set is to ensure big enough heddle-loops.
The <i lang="njh">tsisü</i> are then removed, and the lease-rod is moved down close to the heddle thus giving
the warp enough strain to keep the latter in place. In weaving the shuttle is shot
backwards and forwards by hand, the heddle being raised every alternate pick. To increase
the shed the sword is put in for each pick and turned edgeways. For the check pattern
so common in women’s body-cloths both warp and weft (<i lang="njh">mpyo</i>) are changed. For ornamentation little bits of red wool or yellow thread bought from
a shop are worked in by hand as the weaving progresses, the warp being manipulated
with a porcupine quill. Ordinarily the first weft-element passes alternately over
and under a single warp-element, the second passing over those under which the first
passed. A variety of pattern is that in which a single weft element passes alternately
under and over pairs of warp elements. Another variety is that in which a single weft
element passes under and over alternate pairs of warp elements and is returned under
those under which it passed before, giving a pattern of interwoven pairs of warp and
weft elements. Four pieces of cloth about one foot broad by five feet long go to make
an ordinary man’s cloth. These strips are sewn together along their long sides. The
Lhota needle (<i lang="njh">otyam</i>) is simply a piece of bamboo sharpened at one end. To the head is attached by wax
a piece of thread about two inches long known as <i lang="njh">otyam emhi</i> (“needle-tail”) onto which the thread used for sewing is twisted. The broad stripes
of light blue seen in so many Lhota cloths are invariably separate strips, sewn between
two of the main strips of the cloth. A woman in the old days was forbidden to weave
while her husband was absent on a raid, as it might cause him to trip over creepers
in the jungle and fall into the hands of the enemy.

</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Pottery.</span> Though foreign articles are being used more and more Lhotas still make most of their
own pots. They are round, and slightly contracted at the top, with a curved rim by
which they can be lifted off the fire. The only ornamentation used is a string pattern
which is applied by patting the pot while still wet with a flat piece of wood covered
with coarse <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>string binding (<i lang="njh">khuzü</i>). The clay is obtained from the banks of small streams. Two kinds are used, grey
(<i lang="njh">linyikcho</i>), which is the best, and red (<i lang="njh">linyocho</i>), which is not so good. Only women can make pots, but the industry is not restricted
to old women. The clay is broken up and kneaded on a stone with a little water. After
being left over-night it is again moistened and kneaded. A round base is first made
by hand. A wall of clay is built onto this and kneaded well onto the base with the
left hand, the wall being supported on the outside by a small stick (<i lang="njh">phutamphen</i>) held in the right hand. The pot is then shaped with the left hand and stick, and
put to dry in the sun while other pots are being made.
</p>
<p>After the pots have been dried in the house for three or four days a rough platform
of wood is built on the ground outside the village. On this the pots are laid upside
down and twigs and rubbish and rice straw piled on them and fired. In this kiln the
pots are left till next morning, when they must be taken away before dawn. Certain
precautions have to be observed. The woman making the pots must refrain from sexual
intercourse, and must not eat any strong-smelling food, such as beef, goat’s flesh,
dog’s flesh, dried fish or “stinking dal,” while she is so engaged, for to eat these
things would cause the pots to “ring” badly. Anyone may watch the clay being kneaded,
but no one must look on while the pot is being shaped, and only those helping the
woman by carrying the pots or collecting fuel may be present at the burning. Were
a man to see the pots being fired they would all crack. Nor must any dog come near,
for should so much as a single hair of a dog touch a pot before it is finished the
pot would have a hole at that very place.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Iron-work.</span> The trade of a blacksmith is regarded by the Lhotas as a very unlucky one, and is
restricted to the families members of which have been blacksmiths in the past. It
is believed that no blacksmith lives long after he stops work. It is therefore not
surprising that Lhota blacksmiths are few and far between. Nor is there much need
for them. Villages near the plains buy all they require from Assamese smiths. <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>The Rengmas are great blacksmiths and make all the weapons and implements required
by the Southern Lhotas of the inner ranges, while the Northern Lhotas are supplied
in a similar way by the Aos. The few Lhota blacksmiths there are use foreign tools
bought from the plains, though an indigenous type of bellows (<i lang="njh">yongphophen</i>) is still in use in places. This consists of two sections of bamboo set up perpendicularly
side by side in a clay base. Into each of these is fitted a piston bound all over
with hen’s feathers with their thin ends down. The downward stroke of the piston being
against the “grain” of the feathers and the upward stroke with the “grain,” quite
an efficient valvular action results. These pistons are worked alternately by an assistant
who holds one in each hand. At the bottom of each piston-case is a hole, to which
is attached a bamboo tube (<i lang="njh">zendro</i>). These tubes emerge together at the fire. Only soft iron is used. This is obtained
from the plains in the form of old tea-garden hoes. Formerly iron is said to have
been found and worked at Khoro Ghat on the edge of the plains, by a village of the
Thangwe clan according to one tradition, or by Shans or Burmese according to another.<a class="noteRef" id="n42.1src" href="#n42.1">6</a> The finished article is tempered by being dipped in water. This tempering is not
meant to be final. The purchaser after using the dao, or whatever the article may
be, for a time, heats it in a fire of the slow-burning bark of a certain tree (<i lang="njh">lepokriphu</i>) and tempers it in salt and water, or bamboo-pickle and water to his taste.
</p>
<p>So impregnated with misfortune is the whole trade of the blacksmith that no house
is ever built on the site of an old forge, though the forge is allowed to be built
inside the village. To bring a piece of dross from a forge into a house would cause
all the inmates to fall ill. With this in mind a woman in Yemkha in 1919 left a piece
of dross as a parting present when she ran away from her husband.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Basket-work.</span> Living in a land where cane and bamboo are plentiful Lhotas are naturally expert
basket-makers. Every man can make his own household baskets, but the manufacture of
difficult things such as cane helmets (<i lang="njh">kiven</i>) is generally left to experts. No woman is allowed to do any basket-work of any kind.
For rough baskets strips of fresh bamboo are used. Cane is far more valuable and is
reserved for articles which are meant to last a long time. It is left to season before
being used. For rough work a chequer pattern is generally used, but for shields (<i lang="njh">otsung</i>), cane helmets, and grain baskets a twill pattern is used. A pretty cross-warped
pattern with wefts parallel to each other and passing over and under the same <span class="corr" id="xd31e2765" title="Source: afternate">alternate</span> warps is used for the outside of rain-shields (<i lang="njh">phuchyo</i>), giving an open-work effect rather like the cane seat of a bedroom chair.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Wood-work.</span> Rough planks are hacked out with a dao, a most wasteful method, as the whole thickness
of a tree has to go to make each plank. Wooden dishes are cut out of single pieces
of wood with an adze (<i lang="njh">ophü</i>). They are then dried in the rough and rubbed smooth with stones and a curious rough-surfaced
leaf called <i lang="njh">phukirongti</i> (<i lang="la">Clerodendrum serratum</i>). Small “madhu” vats and very occasionally wooden shields are made in the same way.
The posts of “morungs” (<i lang="njh">champo</i>) are carved in relief with conventional representations of <span class="corr" id="xd31e2787" title="Source: hornbulls">hornbills</span> and mithan heads. The work is done with the dao and is as a rule very rough—far inferior
to the carvings of Semas and Angamis, who in turn are much behind the Konyaks.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Nets.</span> Nets like big landing-nets are made out of twisted strips of bark from the <i lang="njh">erhingya</i> tree. They are fitted onto a circular frame to which a long handle is attached, and
are used to land the stupefied fish which come to the top when a river is “poisoned.”
They are made by men, never by women. The maker must remain chaste the previous night.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Beads.</span> Among the few indigenous beads of the Naga Hills are the little black beads (<i lang="njh">eshe</i>) made from the seeds of a species of wild plantain (<i lang="njh">sheyu</i>) by the Lhotas. The industry is <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>confined to women and exists chiefly among the Southern Lhotas. The seeds are tough,
and both ends of each seed have to be laboriously chewed off. They are astringent,
and “bead chewing” becomes a perfect habit with some women. The seeds are then pierced
with a bamboo needle and strung, and the strings rolled on a flat stone till the beads
become cylindrical and a good polish has been obtained. They are used for necklaces
and look exceedingly well against a brown skin.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Hides.</span> No process of tanning is known. Skins which are required for shields or any other
purpose are merely cleaned and dried in the sun.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Trade.</span> There is no tradition of any old form of currency, such as beads, or gongs, though
thin key-shaped pieces of iron (<i lang="njh">chabli</i>) such as the Aos used to use as currency are occasionally owned as heirlooms. Trade
was apparently always carried on by barter in the days before the British coinage
came into use. Even nowadays cotton which is taken down to the plains is almost invariably
bartered for salt. A peculiar custom obtains when mithan, ivory armlets and boar’s
tushes are bought and sold. These articles are particularly liable to be infected
with evil fortune, certain marks being regarded as unlucky, and so on. An old man
is therefore always employed as an intermediary (<i lang="njh">lantse</i> or <i lang="njh">thantsowe</i>) between the parties, and he finally settles the price when the bargaining has gone
on long enough. Any ill luck is believed to attach itself to him as nominal buyer,
rather than to the real buyer, who pays him a commission of Re. 1 for a mithan, eight
annas for an ivory armlet and four annas for a pair of boar’s tushes. If anything
intimately connected with the person, such as a cloth or a dao, be sold the seller
retains a thread from the cloth or scrapes a tiny shaving off the handle of the dao,
for were he to sell the whole of something which was almost part of himself the buyer
might be able to exercise some magical influence over him.<a class="noteRef" id="n44.1src" href="#n44.1">7</a>

must be paid before all other debts. The highest rate of interest is demanded for
salt, for which 100 per cent. per annum compound interest has to be paid. The result
is that loans of salt are promptly repaid.

<h3 class="main"><i>Agriculture.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Method of cultivation.</span> The Lhota is above all an agriculturist. Rarely does his ambition extend beyond a
bumper crop. Service under Government has few attractions for him. Even if he takes
a post he often throws it up after a year or two and says he would rather go back
and live in his village and cultivate his land. Rice is the staple food of the tribe
and is far and away the most important crop grown. The method of cultivation is that
known as “jhuming.” A piece of jungle is cut and burnt, and the land cultivated for
two years and then allowed to go back to jungle, under which it remains for a period
varying from four to fifteen years. If a man is short of land he obviously has to
cultivate each piece at shorter intervals. If he is the lord of wide acres the intervals
are longer. The bigger the jungle is allowed to grow the more will mould accumulate
and the thicker will be the deposit of ash when it is burnt. On an average among the
Lhotas a piece of land is cultivated once in ten years. The whole village cultivates
in one block, each man having his own piece of land. Isolated patches of cultivation
would merely provide food for wild pig, monkeys and other pests. The jungle is cut
about December.<a class="noteRef" id="n45.1src" href="#n45.1">8</a> (The times <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>of agricultural operations vary a good deal according to the height and climate of
the village concerned.) When the time comes to begin operations each man goes to his
land and clears a little piece of jungle. Should he see a snake while so occupied
he probably runs home as fast as his legs will carry him, for he would die were he
to cultivate that piece of land. If no such evil omen occurs he cuts a stake, sets
it up, cuts a notch in the side, puts a little earth from a worm-cast in the notch
and goes home. This is regarded as a sort of oath that the owner proposes to clear
that piece of jungle. He carefully notes what dreams he has that night. Sometimes
he puts a twig from the jungle in question under his head. A bad dream would be enough
to make him select another piece of land for that year. On the day when he puts up
the stake he must not eat meat from a tiger’s kill or the flesh of dog, goat or cattle.
His wife may cook his food for him, but he must eat separately from her in the morning,
having remained chaste the night before. In clearing the jungle everyone takes part—men,
women and children. A man helps his friends and they help him. The jungle is cleared
from the bottom of the slope upwards. Bushes and saplings are cut close to the ground.
Big trees are left standing, but thin branches are trimmed so that they shall not
shade the crop. Usually a bunch of leaves is left growing at the top of big trees
of which the other branches are pruned away. Lhotas attach no particular significance
to this practice; but among the Aos it appears to be followed only by rich men.<a class="noteRef" id="n46.1src" href="#n46.1">9</a>
</p>
<p>The jungle is left till March to dry, when it is all burnt on the same day. The man
who is to start the fire is selected by cutting little chips from a piece of stick
and watching how they fall—the ordinary Lhota way of taking omens. The man chosen
first makes fire with a fire-stick and sets <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>the dry jungle alight. Then everyone joins in and lights a long line of fire which
sweeps uphill till it dies out in the green, uncut jungle at the top. Next day is
<i lang="njh">emung</i>. After that work begins in earnest. Stones and half-burnt logs are collected and
little barriers (<i lang="njh">oliecho</i>) are built along the hillsides to prevent the earth being washed away. Sometimes,
as at Mangya, rough stone terrace walls are built. The fields are then dug over with
a single-handed digger (<i lang="njh">chukchü</i>), a small triangular iron blade fitted like an adze onto a bamboo handle. This preliminary
hoeing is omitted by most Northern Lhota villages, who merely clear the land of rubbish
before sowing. The fields which have already carried a crop the year before are now
weeded, and the weeds gathered into heaps with a small <span class="corr" id="xd31e2870" title="Source: bambo">bamboo</span> rake (<i lang="njh">keya</i>) and burnt.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Sowing and the ceremonies connected with it.</span> Before anyone can sow his land certain ceremonies have to be performed. The first
of these is <i lang="njh">Thruven</i>, which is performed first by the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>, and after him in the course of the next few days by anyone who has dragged a stone
or done the <i lang="njh">Etha</i> ceremony. The procedure is as follows. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> goes with his wife to the spot (<i lang="njh">Thruvenphen</i>) just outside the village where tradition says this ceremony must be performed, generally
near the <i lang="njh">opya</i>—the post set up and speared at the <i lang="njh">Oyantsoa</i> ceremony. He takes with him a twig of bamboo (a shoot growing up directly from the
ground will not do), some chicken meat, boiled rice, “pita madhu,” ginger, a little
seed-rice, and some seeds of a plant with a variegated leaf called <i lang="njh">orho</i>. After pouring a little “madhu” on the ground, he arranges four pieces of the bamboo
twig in the form of a square and puts a large leaf on the ground to his right and
another on his left. On the right-hand leaf he puts ten little pieces, and on the
left-hand leaf nine little pieces each of thatching grass, ginger, and chicken meat,
and sprinkles a little seed-rice over each heap. The heaps are then tied up in the
leaves and put in the square of bamboo twigs. Then close by he sows the <i lang="njh">orho</i> seeds, making a miniature fence round them, the sticks of which are tied together
at the top. This is a purely formal act, and it does not seem to matter in the least
<span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>whether the <i lang="njh">orho</i> seeds ever come up or not. Next morning the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> sows six seeds of rice in his garden plot. This formal sowing of rice is omitted
by the other men who do the <i lang="njh">Thruven</i> ceremony. Sexual intercourse is forbidden the night after this ceremony. When the
last man has finished the village keeps one day’s <i lang="njh">emung</i>. Anyone who has been married the previous winter, and everyone who has done all social
“gennas” and dragged a stone performs a further ceremony before sowing his fields.
Among the Northern Lhotas it is done as follows. In the morning one of the old women
who acted as <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i><a class="noteRef" id="n48.1src" href="#n48.1">10</a> at his wedding, or failing her any old man of his clan who has done no social “gennas,”
comes to his house, and there ties eight <i lang="njh">nungyung</i> leaves into two bundles of four. She then goes alone down the path leading to his
fields, taking with her the <i lang="njh">nungyung</i> leaves, two bamboo “chungas,” some rice, and a smouldering brand—for fire is a great
protection against evil spirits. She faces towards the fields and lays a bundle of
<i lang="njh">nungyung</i> leaves on each side of the path, with a “chunga” on each bundle, and a little bit
of smoking brand behind it. She then goes straight to her own home, taking with her
the rice, which is her fee. Next day the owner goes down to the field with his friends
and sows a little patch first, praying that his crop may be as close as elephant grass,
as spreading as a rubber tree and free from weeds. He must refrain from sexual intercourse
the night before he does this, and must neither take food nor speak to anyone in the
morning till he has sown the first patch. Among the Southern Lhotas the old man or
woman who does the ceremony on the first day puts on each side of the path a little
heap of rice husks, a smouldering stick and two crossed <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves, on which are put six pieces of burnt wood, six pieces of pork, a little boiled
rice and a sprinkling of “madhu.” The owner of the field must not eat any of the pig
which provides the pork used here. The formal act of sowing takes place next day as
among the Northern Lhotas. Both on the night preceding and the night after the formal
sowing sexual intercourse is forbidden among the Southern Lhotas, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>in the morning before going to his fields the man must eat separately from his wife,
though she may cook his food. Unlike his neighbours the Aos, the Lhota does not sow
broadcast. With the digger (<i lang="njh">chukchü</i>) held in his right hand he scratches a little hole. His left hand is full of seed-rice,
of which he allows four or five grains to drop between the middle and index finger
into the hole, which is filled in with a stroke of the digger. Both men and women
sow. The day’s supply of seed-rice is carried in a basket on the left hip, the sowers
working their way in a line from the bottom of the hill upwards. From the time the
crop is sown till it ripens everyone is busy keeping his fields as free from weeds
as possible. The weeder (<i lang="njh">ehe</i>) is a strip of iron about nine inches long and one inch broad, bent into a semicircle
and fixed to a short bamboo handle.<a class="noteRef" id="n49.1src" href="#n49.1">11</a> Every field is weeded at least twice, and often as many as six times—the oftener
the better. The weeds are collected into heaps along the edges of the fields, or on
stony patches where nothing will grow.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Motharatsen</i> ceremony.</span> Among the Southern Lhotas a yearly ceremony called <i lang="njh">Motharatsen</i> is performed by the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> and <i lang="njh">Yenga</i> only when the crop is about half grown to prevent it being damaged by a small white
grub (<i lang="njh">ora</i>). On a certain day of which he has given previous notice the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> collects unhusked rice from the whole village and with some of it buys a pig. This
he kills on the day of the ceremony, and going outside the village lays ten pieces
of meat and ten pieces of ginger (<i lang="njh">osing</i>) on crossed <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves to his right, and nine pieces of meat and ginger on crossed <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves to his left. The next day is <i lang="njh">emung</i>. Though the Northern Lhotas still keep the <i lang="njh">emung</i> the ceremony has fallen into abeyance among them. But the Southern Lhotas firmly
believe in its efficacy. In 1918 the people of Yanthămo attributed the failure of
their crops to the fact that a stranger from another village had entered the house
of their <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> after he had collected the subscription of rice and before he had performed the ceremony.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Amungkam</i> ceremony.</span> When the rice comes into the ear ceremonies are again performed to ensure a good
crop. The first ceremony is called <i lang="njh">Amungkam</i>, and is performed by the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> and <i lang="njh">Yenga</i> at the spot (<i lang="njh">amungkampen</i>) a little way outside the village at which it was performed when the village was
founded. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> kills and cooks a little boar at his own house and goes with his <i lang="njh">Yenga</i> to the <i lang="njh">amungkampen</i>, taking with him a new cooking-pot, some of the boar’s meat, a small live pig, a
hen, an egg, a fire-stick and some <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves. The <i>Puthi’s</i> wife may accompany him, but the <i>Yenga’s</i> wife must stay behind. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> makes a fire with the fire-stick, and near it lays out four bamboo twigs in the form
of a square, in the middle of which he sets up the egg on end, flanked on either side
with forty-two small pieces of meat on crossed <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves. He then spears the live pig, praying to <i lang="njh">Rangsi</i>, the deity of the crops, that they may be good. The pig is singed over the fire and
cut up, the stomach and entrails being cooked in the new pot and eaten by the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>. The rest of the meat is divided up, one piece for every man in the village who has
dragged a stone. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> then strangles the chicken between the finger and thumb of his right hand and watches
how the excreta fall as it struggles. If they are dry there will not be much rain
and the crops will ripen well. If they are watery, storms will cause the crops to
rot. The entrails are next taken out and examined. If they are full the crop will
be good; if they are empty it will be poor. These are pushed back into the chicken,
which is placed on the ground by the egg. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> builds a little fence round the offering and hangs up the fire-stick on it, the pot
being turned upside down and left on the ground. He then goes home and calls his friends
to his house to drink “madhu” and partake of the pig he killed before leaving home.
To each guest he offers a piece of pork and asks if he intends to do the <i lang="njh">Rangsikam</i> ceremony, which is voluntary. To accept the pork means that the answer is in the
affirmative. To refuse it means that the answer is in the negative. Early on the morning
of the next day, which is <i lang="njh">emung</i>, the villagers go and see if a wild cat or other animal has taken away the chicken
which had <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>been left at <i lang="njh">amungkampen</i>. For it to be taken away forbodes ill for the village.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Rangsikam</i> ceremony.</span> In Akuk no one may do the <i lang="njh">Rangsikam</i> ceremony till after the <i lang="njh">Lanvung</i> “genna,” but in other villages it may be done either before or after. The ceremony,
which is also known as <i lang="njh">Likam</i>, is performed as follows. The master of the house having slept apart from his wife
the night before and eaten apart from her in the morning, though she may cook his
food, kills a pig, and taking the cooked meat, “madhu,” boiled rice, a live hen and
a new pot, goes down to his field-house—a shed built by each man in his fields where
he can shelter from the rain or eat his mid-day meal with his wife and family. Having
made a fire with a fire-stick inside the house he holds the hen by the wings with
his right hand and walks round the outside of the house, swinging the hen and calling
out the names of all the different varieties of rice he knows, whether he has sown
them or not, and asking <i lang="njh">Rangsi</i> to give him a good crop of them. He then strangles the chicken and takes the omens
exactly as the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> does in the <i lang="njh">Amungkam</i> ceremony. It is worth noting that this is the only occasion on which anything is
killed in the field-house. Otherwise it is forbidden to bring raw meat of any kind
into a field-house, or kill anything or have sexual intercourse in it. This is why
the approaches to field-houses near paths are often “panjied” as a gentle reminder
to passers-by that they must not run in to shelter from the rain if they are carrying
raw meat. To resume, the hen is plucked, and cooked in the new pot. It is not eaten
by the sacrificer, but is taken back to the village and given to an old man of his
clan. The entrails are put in the pot, which is covered with a leaf and buried up
to the rim behind the <span class="corr" id="xd31e3097" title="Source: field house">field-house</span>. The little bamboo basket in which the hen was brought is stuck all over with its
feathers and put, together with the fire-stick, beside the pot. All then wash their
hands and the proceedings end with a meal from the provisions brought down. From the
time when the preparation of the “madhu” for this ceremony is begun till the ceremony
is over, sexual intercourse is forbidden and no member of the household <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>must touch a corpse, meat from a tiger’s kill or the flesh of cattle, dogs or goats.
On the day of the ceremony no man from another village may enter the house before
the family go down to the field-house.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Lanvung</i> ceremony.</span> In the damp climate of Assam jungle grows with extraordinary speed. The seventh day
after the <i lang="njh">Amungkam emung</i> is set aside for a united path-clearing (<i lang="njh">Lanvung</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="n52.1src" href="#n52.1">12</a> by the whole village. During the six days preceding the <i lang="njh">Lanvung</i> day nothing may be sold or killed in the village, and no one may touch a tiger’s
kill, or perform any “genna” such as <i lang="njh">Potsokam</i> or <i lang="njh">Etchhienya</i>. On the seventh day the working companies each kill a big pig, every man subscribing
his share of the price. The next day is a general picnic and the whole village turns
out to clear the jungle from the paths. There is much feasting and drinking, and the
bucks have jumping competitions and perform feats of strength. Among the Northern
Lhotas as each branch path is cleared roof-shaped bamboo erections (<i lang="njh">vangkoseng</i>), like double pen racks with bamboos laid on them in the place of pens, are set up
at each fork, to the accompaniment of much ho-hoing.<a class="noteRef" id="n52.2src" href="#n52.2">13</a> The next day is <i lang="njh">emung</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Protection of crops.</span> While the crop is ripening the owner is kept busy protecting it from the ravages
of beasts and birds. Little look-outs (<i lang="njh">zengki</i>) are built in the trees, well out of the reach of an elephant’s trunk. Wild animals
are driven away by shouting or clapping two pieces of bamboo together, or blowing
a bamboo trumpet (<i lang="njh">phupphu</i>), or by building a big fire and feeding it with bamboos, which go off with a loud
bang as each section is burst by the expanding hot air inside it. There is no hedge
between field and field, but a rough fence is built round the whole block of village
cultivation in order to keep out deer and cattle. In the old days low gaps were left
in the fence here and there. Any deer which gave way to temptation and jumped through
one of these gaps found <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>itself impaled on “panjis.” Monkeys are most destructive and difficult to get rid
of. One plan is to catch a small monkey, pierce its ears and ornament them with large
lumps of cotton-wool. It is then let go and tries to rejoin the troop, who promptly
turn tail at the sight of this strange apparition. The more the troop runs away the
harder the little monkey tries to catch them, and the harder it tries to catch them,
the faster they go. To drive away birds pieces of bamboo leaf-sheaf, sometimes cut
into the rough outline of a hovering hawk, are tied from the end of a string to a
pole and put to flutter in the breeze.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The eating of first-fruits.</span> Just before the crop begins to ripen the ceremony of eating the first-fruits (<i lang="njh">Mshe etak</i>) is performed, by the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> first, and after him by the other households in the village. From the day on which
the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> announces that he is preparing his “madhu” to that on which the last man does the
ceremony, no stranger may enter the <i>Puthi’s</i> house, and selling and killing of fowls and animals and the bringing of meat into
the village are prohibited as they are before the <i lang="njh">Lanvung</i> ceremony. On the day of the ceremony the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> kills a little boar outside his house. He does not eat this meat but distributes
it to all the houses in the village in which there has been a death during the year.
These portions are offered to the dead in the <i lang="njh">Etchhienya</i> ceremony. After killing the pig he goes into his house accompanied by his <i lang="njh">Yenga</i> and the second <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> if there be one, and in the presence of his family strangles a hen, with a prayer
to the <i lang="njh">Rangsi</i> that there may be good crops, no accidents, no raids by enemies, and no prowling
tigers. He then takes the omens from the excreta and entrails in the ordinary way.
The <i>Puthi’s</i> wife,<a class="noteRef" id="n53.1src" href="#n53.1">14</a> or the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> himself if he be a widower, now goes and cuts the rice sown in the garden plot at
the <i lang="njh">Thruven</i> ceremony, no matter how unripe it may be. This the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> husks in silence. He may be helped by the assistant <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> but by no one else. He puts a little of the grain on the sickle, on both his feet,
against his forehead and finally on the hearth-stones. What is left he wraps up in
a leaf and half boils. This he pretends, to eat, praying that squirrels, rats <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>and birds may find the rice of the village crops bitter. It is then thrown away, but
the hen is eaten. During the next day or two everyone goes down to his fields and
brings up a little rice, with which he performs the same ceremony, except that no
hen or pig is killed. A little of this rice is preserved and kept wrapped in a leaf
at the bottom of the “chunga” or other receptacle in which the day’s supply of grain
is put every morning. Such is the custom among the Northern Lhotas. Among the Southern
Lhotas no rice is put on the sickle, feet, hearth, etc., but the rice is eaten by
the whole family with crabs as a relish.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Reaping ceremonies.</span> The crops ripen about August, those in the old fields being ready first, and as soon
as <i lang="njh">Mshe etak</i> is over everyone may cut his rice as soon as it is ready. On the day when he first
goes down to cut his crop each man performs at his field-house a ceremony called <i lang="njh">Liritang</i> in honour of the <i lang="njh">Rangsi</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n54.1src" href="#n54.1">15</a> He takes down with him “<i>Rangsi’s</i> load” (<i lang="njh">Rangsi’ha</i>) containing a cooked pig’s head, a gourd of “madhu,” an egg, a little salt, some
cooked rice and the leaves of <i lang="njh">sangsu</i> (a long thin leaf), <i lang="njh">lhetyak</i> (a hairy leaf), and <i lang="njh">orungu</i> (a small leaf, white on the underside). Having arrived at his field-house and seen
that all who are to help him that day have come, for no one may come once he has begun
the ceremony—he lights a fire with a fire-stick, takes four blades of thatching grass
from the roof and bends them double, and places six grains of rice on the threshold
(<i lang="njh">likingko</i>) of the field-house. He then cracks the egg over the six grains of rice and pours
the contents into the leaf in which he wrapped it when he left his house. This leaf
he ties to the post of the field-house, taking it home when he goes in the evening
and either giving the contents to his children or eating them himself. He then lights
the thatching grass at the fire, and holding the <i lang="njh">orungu</i>, <i lang="njh">sangsu</i> and <i lang="njh">lhetyak</i> leaves with the thatching grass in his right hand, goes outside the house and waves
them with a sweeping motion from left to right, the smoke from the thatching grass
thus driving evil spirits away. He then says the following<a class="noteRef" id="n54.2src" href="#n54.2">16</a> traditional words:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p><i lang="njh">Orung-na ranga ranga phang</i> (<i lang="njh">orungu</i>, asking, asking remain). <i lang="njh">Lhetyak-na tyaka tyaka phang</i> (<i lang="njh"><span class="corr" id="xd31e3269" title="Source: lehtyak">lhetyak</span></i>, sweeping, sweeping remain). <i lang="njh">Sangsu-na sangsu lithana</i>, <i lang="njh">sangsu lithana oro tamtam chudechia</i> (<i lang="njh">sangsu, sangsu</i>, changing, changing with <i lang="njh">sangsu</i>, coming in a stream pour out).
</p>
<p>This is said to mean—for the words are not clearly understood by the Lhotas themselves:
“<i lang="njh">Orungu</i> leaves pray the Rangsi continually to give me a good crop; <i lang="njh">lhetyak</i> leaves sweep the grain into my field-house, and <i lang="njh">sangsu</i> leaves come one after the other and pour rice in a stream from your loads into my
field-house.” The man then re-enters the house and sprinkles the floor with “madhu”
from his gourd while he repeats the following words:—
</p>
<p><span class="intra"><span lang="njh" class="top">“Satung</span> <span lang="en" class="bottom"><span class="corr" id="xd31e3302" title="Not in source">“</span>Fish-trap</span></span>

</p>
<p>In other words he prays to all <i>Rangsis</i> belonging to men who are busy fishing or snaring birds by the pools or are hurt (<i>i.e.</i> all men who do no cultivation and so have no need of <i>Rangsis</i>), together will all the <i>Rangsis</i> of the hillside to come and help him. The “madhu” is then sprinkled along the threshold
from end to end and the ceremony is at an end and reaping begins. At midday the owner
and his helpers come back to the field house for a meal. The owner first undoes the
pig’s head and puts salt on it. This can be eaten only by him and old people. If he
happens to have an <i lang="njh">oha</i> (luck-stone) in his house, no one but he can eat the pig’s head, or they will have
a bad cough.
</p>
<p>The crop is reaped with a small iron sickle (<i lang="njh">vekhuo</i>) with a saw edge. Several stalks are grasped together with the left hand and cut
a few inches below the ears. The unthreshed rice is stored in the field-house till
everyone in the village has reaped his crop. Each man on the day when he first goes
down to thresh again performs the <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span><i lang="njh">Liritang</i> ceremony as before, except that a fowl—either cock or hen—takes the place of the
pig’s head. To thresh the grain the ears are heaped on mats outside the field-house,
and after being well trampled are flicked against the right shin.<a class="noteRef" id="n56.1src" href="#n56.1">17</a> To winnow the grain one man pours it slowly from a basket held with both hands above
his head while another fans it vigorously with a winnowing fan (<i lang="njh">saveng</i>)—a bamboo mat with the two corners of one end drawn together, resulting in a thing
rather like a sugar scoop in shape.
</p>
<p>All that remains now is to carry up the grain as fast as possible. If the fields are
a long way from the village, small temporary granaries (<i lang="njh">echengrangki</i>) are built half-way in which the crop can be stored till the field-house, where wild
pig and elephants are likely to do most damage, has been emptied. The grain is carried
up in baskets (<i lang="njh">otyak</i>), and every man, woman and child in the village helps, going down to the fields with
torches in their hands long before dawn and coming up with the last load long after
sunset. When the harvest is safely in each man goes down and rolls up the mats in
his field-house, and takes them home, uttering as he does so a prayer to <i lang="njh">Phuri Rangsi</i> (Mister Rangsi) to be favourable to him next year. Ahead of him lie a few weeks of
well-earned rest till the time comes to cut the jungle for the next year’s crop.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Varieties of rice.</span> Many varieties of rice, both white and red-grained, are sown by the Lhotas. For example,
the principal kinds in Okotso are as follows:—White, <i lang="njh">amorü</i> (very coarse), <i lang="njh">otsi emhuho</i> (coarse), <i lang="njh">laza</i> (medium), <i lang="njh">motiro</i> (fine), <i lang="njh">wochio</i> (with black husk), <i lang="njh">tambaktsok</i> (with red husk): Red, <i lang="njh">oriepyo</i> (coarse), <i lang="njh">kamtiya</i> (fine), <i lang="njh">santungo</i> (fine), <i lang="njh">moyo</i> (fine), <i lang="njh">changkiu</i> (fine), and <i lang="njh">mhumyandhro</i> (very fine). No variety is used exclusively either for eating or for “madhu,” but
the best kinds for “madhu” are <i lang="njh">santungo</i>, <i lang="njh">otsi emhuho</i>, <i lang="njh">oriepyo</i>, <i lang="njh">kamtiya</i> and <i lang="njh">moyo</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Other crops.</span> Besides rice there are a number of subsidiary crops, generally sown along the edges
of the fields or in patches among the rice. Maize (<i lang="njh">tsunghundhro</i>) is sown along the boundaries <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>of the fields, or among the chilies, never in large patches, which would only attract
bears. Millet (<i lang="la">Setaria italica</i>, Lhota <i lang="njh">teni</i>) is not an important crop as it is among the Semas and Changs, though a good deal
is grown by some of the villages high up on the slopes of Wokha Hill. It is sown about
February and cut about July. Giant millet (<i lang="la">Sorghum vulgare</i>, Lhota <i lang="njh">lichophuk</i>) is sown mostly along the boundaries of fields, the time being about the same as
that of millet. Job’s tears (<i lang="njh">omung</i>) is also sown along the edges of fields at the same time as the rice and ripens about
ten days or a fortnight later. Of taro (<i lang="la">Colocasia antiquorum</i>, Lhota <i lang="njh">mani</i>) there are several varieties, the principal being <i lang="njh">tsampang</i> (large, reddish root), <i lang="njh">vakhundro</i> (small root) and <i lang="njh">loro</i> (a very large root). This is generally planted along the little soil-barriers (<i lang="njh">oliecho</i>) and scattered among the rice, but sometimes a patch of ground is devoted exclusively
to it. Chilies (<i lang="njh">machi</i>) are sown both in the garden patches and on low rich land at the bottom of the fields.
The sowing takes place in March, and the plants begin to bear in July. It is a biennial,
and in the second year begins to produce pods in May. If left for a third year there
will be a few pods, but they are small and shrivelled. Cotton (<i lang="njh">khungko</i>), after rice, is the most important Lhota crop. Sufficient is grown for home consumption
and for a considerable export trade. It is sown in March on sunny slopes from which
light jungle has been cleared, preferably with a rather gritty soil, and is ready
for plucking in October. Whole fields are devoted exclusively to it, but it is an
annual and is never sown twice running on the same ground. Several varieties of lentil
(<i lang="njh">orho</i>) are grown, all climbers. It is sown in March at the base of the trees left standing
about the fields and plucked in October. “Stinking dal” (<i lang="njh">limcham</i> or <i lang="njh">nyingtyingsing</i>) only grows to the height of French beans. Whole fields are often given up to it,
and it is often sown in rotation after cotton in February or March, and is ready about
November. When the rice is sown, lufas (<i lang="njh">longchungo</i>) are sown at the foot of trees in the field. The green gourd-like fruit is eaten
in October, and in January the dry fruit is plucked, the stiff fibrous interior <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>being used to clean pots, etc. Big and small gourds (<i lang="njh">shammo</i> and <i lang="njh">zükhe</i>) are grown for their hard shells, which are used as bottles. They are sown along
the edges of fields in March and are ripe in October. A very insipid variety of water-melon
(<i lang="njh">hmeliti</i>) is sown scattered about among the rice and is ready from July on. Several varieties
of thick, short cucumber (<i lang="njh">lishakti</i>) are sown at the same time as the rice and ripen from July to November. Black sesame
(<i lang="la">Sesamum indicum</i>, Lhota <i lang="njh">penching</i>) and white oil seed (<i lang="la">Perilla ocimoides</i>, Lhota <i lang="njh">pentsü</i>) are sown in March along the boundaries of the fields, the crop being ready in October
or November. In cold villages whole fields of <i lang="njh">pentsü</i> are grown. Tobacco (<i lang="njh">mukuyo</i>) is extensively grown both in garden plots and in corners of fields set apart for
it, as well as along the boundaries and scattered about among the rice. It is sown
in March, and gives a continual crop of leaves from August on. Indigo (<i lang="la">Strobilanthes flaccidifolius</i>, Lhota <i lang="njh">tchemo</i>) is grown to a certain extent in garden plots, but chiefly in damp, shady places
in the jungle. Cuttings are put in in May and June, and are full grown by August of
the next year. It is forbidden for men to touch this plant. The only garden vegetable
grown is mustard (<i lang="njh">hangi</i>), the leaves of which are eaten. A kind of giant taro (<i lang="njh">taktsü</i>) is grown in gardens occasionally for its leaves, which are used to line the baskets
in which “madhu” rice is set to stand. No part of the plant is ever eaten.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Flowers.</span> The Lhota likes to have flowers handy to put in his ears, and grows a few varieties
in his little garden. The chief kinds are wild canna (<i lang="njh">lentala</i>), wild cock’s-comb (<i lang="njh">thropentera</i>), marigold (<i lang="njh">yantantera</i>), a small purple flower (<i lang="njh">kambentera</i>), a pale yellow flower (<i lang="njh">narisen</i>), and a red flower (<i lang="njh">echamtera</i>).
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Fruit, etc.</span> A large number of oranges<a class="noteRef" id="n58.1src" href="#n58.1">18</a> (<i lang="njh">tsampen</i> or <i lang="njh">khongkeng</i>) and bitter oranges (<i lang="njh">tsampenyimo</i>—“foolish orange”) are grown in <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>the hot villages, a considerable trade in the former being carried on with the plains.
The trees are grown from pips and are never manured or pruned or looked after in any
way. Other fruit trees are the pomegranate (<i lang="njh">tsaramtiven</i>), which is propagated by cuttings, and a huge plantain (<i lang="njh">echamyuti</i>), which is <span class="corr" id="xd31e3654" title="Source: horriby">horribly</span> wooden and astringent and has to be cooked before it can be eaten even by a Lhota.
The Christians of Okotso now grow a few tea bushes (<i lang="njh">cha</i>). A very small number of betel nut palms (<i lang="njh">mma</i>) are to be found in villages on the range nearest the plains. These villages do a
big trade in “pan” leaves (<i lang="njh">lamo</i>) with the plains, where hill “pan” fetches a good price. The “pan” vines are grown
up trees in the jungle wherever the soil is suitable. They are not cultivated in any
way, but every vine belongs to some individual though it is growing in unreclaimed
jungle. The vines are propagated by means of cuttings.

<p class="first">Mithan (<i lang="la">Bos frontalis</i>, Lhota <i lang="njh">tsiro</i>) are regarded as a sign of wealth, but are no longer kept in large numbers by the
Lhotas. They do a lot of damage to the crops, and as an investment are too risky to
suit the taste of the careful Lhota, being very liable to rinderpest, an outbreak
of which may kill off a whole herd. Further, they are practically only used for sacrificial
purposes, for which cattle will do almost as well. Bulls which are marked in such
a way that it would be unlucky to sacrifice them are sometimes killed for food, but
cows are only eaten when they die of old age or disease. A pure-bred mithan is black,
with white stockings and grey forehead, but many individuals are found marked with
white or brown on the body. This appears to be due to the fact that the strain of
mithan in the Naga Hills has become hopelessly contaminated by allowing them to interbreed
with cattle.<a class="noteRef" id="n59.1src" href="#n59.1">19</a> An ordinary <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>cow mated with a mithan bull produces a hybrid, which in turn is fertile when mated
with a mithan. The result of this cross when again mated with a mithan produces an
animal which in size and shape resembles a mithan, but which often shows its humble
origin in its colouring. Animals of this unpure strain have contaminated the whole
breed and any pair of mithan is liable to produce a throw-back. Though mithan calves
are sometimes tied up outside the owner’s house till their legs get strong, the animals
are generally allowed to run more or less wild in the jungle, the owner merely calling
them and giving them salt occasionally. Beasts are occasionally marked by having their
ears split. No bells are worn and no herdsman is kept to look after mithan or any
kind of cattle. When a mithan calf is born the owner observes six days’ “genna” if
it is a bull and five days’ if it is a cow. During those days no stranger from another
village can enter his house and he must not eat meat from a tiger’s kill. This “genna”
is observed for the calves of all cattle. In the case of mithan a necklace of six
seeds of the sword-bean (<i lang="njh">khuro</i>) is put on the neck of a bull calf, and one of five seeds on the neck of a cow calf,
and after being worn for a few hours is taken off and hung up in the owner’s house.<a class="noteRef" id="n60.1src" href="#n60.1">20</a> A curious custom which appears to be common to all Nagas and applies to cattle of
all kinds and often to pigs, is that by which a man will own half or one leg of an
animal. Often a man prefers to distribute his risk by investing in a share in a number
of mithan rather than own the whole of two or three beasts. The hybrid (<i lang="njh">tyangtso</i>) of a mithan bull and ordinary cow is a black or very dark brown animal midway between
its parents in size. They are allowed to run wild, but generally come and sleep in
the village. Large numbers of ordinary cattle (<i lang="njh">mangsü</i>) are bought in the plains. They are of the common Assamese breed, and miserable creatures
as a rule. Some are kept for food and breeding, but usually they are taken straight
through into the Ao and Sema country and sold. <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>The Lhota never milks his cattle, simply because it is not the custom to do so, but
he will drink milk if it is offered to him. There is a black and black-and-white breed
of cattle known as <i lang="njh">süpi</i> which the Lhotas regard as indigenous to their country. These carry a good deal more
meat than the Assamese cattle. All cattle are allowed to run loose in the jungle,
the owner only going to have a look at them every two or three days. Buffalo (<i lang="njh">juzü</i>) which are past work are sometimes bought in the plains and brought up for food,
but they are never bred by Lhotas and are useless for sacrificial purpose, as they
are regarded as “stupid” beasts. Pigs (<i lang="njh">woko</i>) swarm in Lhota villages and a man must be very poor indeed not to keep one or two.
They are closely akin to the wild pig, with which they occasionally interbreed. When
a sow farrows the owner observes five days’ “genna.” Every boar is castrated when
it is only about two months old. This operation is generally performed with a sharp
piece of bamboo by a man who is known to be skilled at it. Ashes having been put on
the wound it is sewn up, and the little pig runs off apparently none the worse. The
ears of all boars are clipped at the time when they are castrated. Little pigs are
generally shut up in the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> at night, but when they get big they are allowed to roam about the village at will,
only coming home for a meal of rice husks, “madhu” waste and taro once a day. A pig
which is a bad wanderer and does not come home as it should is punished by having
its ears pierced and a piece of string run through them and tied to the wall of the
house.<a class="noteRef" id="n61.1src" href="#n61.1">21</a> Ordinarily dogs are the only animals to which names are given, but in some villages
pigs are called after the person from whom they are bought, a custom which is generally
viewed with no great favour by the seller if he gets to hear of it. Sometimes little
pigs become household pets. I knew one in <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>Seleku which spent most of its time playing with the children. It had its own special
cloth spread for it by the fire and would sleep nowhere else. It was sold by its callous
owner when it began to get big, and no doubt became pork shortly afterwards. Goats
(<i lang="njh">nyanya</i>) are kept in large numbers, white goats with long hair being particularly valuable.
This hair is sold to be dyed red and used for all kinds of ornaments. The wretched
animals used to be plucked alive, one goat giving several crops. But this has now
been stopped and the hair is cut off. Goats being particularly attractive to leopards,
they are kept at night in little houses (<i lang="njh">nyanyarangki</i>) placed high up on poles in the village, a couple of notched posts forming a ladder
up which they can scramble.
</p>
<p>Except in the villages near the plains, where they are supplanted by Assamese curs,
Lhota dogs are of the ordinary Naga type, black, with white chest and often one or
more white paws. There are often brown and white markings on the body, and one type
is entirely white with long hair.<a class="noteRef" id="n62.1src" href="#n62.1">22</a> The latter used to be plucked alive as white goats were and their hair used for ornaments.
All dogs have names. Examples are <i lang="njh">Keri</i> (“white paws,” lit. gauntlets), <i lang="njh">Pangri</i> (“piebald”), <i lang="njh">Humthe</i> (“soft-haired”), <i lang="njh">Phunyung</i> (“red dog”), <i lang="njh">Taphuno</i> (“stay-at-home,” lit. “hearth dog”), <i lang="njh">Mhakuk</i> (“ditch-on-face,” <i>i.e.</i> with a depression over the nose), <i lang="njh">Kimung</i> (“stay-in-the-house”), <i lang="njh">Yimo</i> (“fool”), <i lang="njh">Okharo</i> (“little one,” a pet name for the last-born child). The tails of all dogs are cut
short, and the ears of male dogs are also clipped. The severed bits of tail are put
in a cleft stick and stuck up in the house out of the way of rats, for were a rat
to eat a tail the puppy to which it lately belonged would die. A Lhota feeds and treats
all his dogs well, but is especially careful of his hunting dogs. They <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>are never punished as other dogs are, the result being that they are hopelessly disobedient.
It is quite common for the dogs to spoil a whole day’s hunting by going off on the
wrong line and remaining deaf to their masters’ shouts. Hunting dogs are never eaten,
and when one dies it is wrapped in a cloth and given decent burial outside the village.
A Lhota strokes but never pats his dog. When he wants to make much of it he holds
its head between his hands and allows it to lick his face, returning the compliment
by dribbling onto its nose. When a bitch has puppies her owner observes five days’
“genna,” with the same restrictions as in the case of cattle and pigs. Cats (<i lang="njh">onyiro</i>) are never kept, though they are occasionally bought in the plains and eaten.
</p>
<p>The Lhota fowl (<i lang="njh">hono</i>) much resembles the red jungle fowl (<i lang="la">Gallus ferrugineus</i>), with which it often interbreeds. Crosses with the kalij pheasant (<i lang="la">Gennæus horsfieldi</i>) too are by no means unknown. Fowls live on what they can pick up, but never seem
to wander far from home. Old baskets are put up on shelves in the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> for hens to lay in and hatch their chickens out of the reach of rats. The owner must
take the chickens down from the basket either after sunset or before sunrise. Before
doing so he puts a piece of burnt wood (or in some villages five pieces of burnt wood)
into the basket and says: “When you wander may you not be lost or fall a prey to wild
cat or hawk.” The egg-shells are strung on a bit of bamboo and hung up in the house,
it is said in order to keep a reckoning of the number of eggs hatched in the year.<a class="noteRef" id="n63.1src" href="#n63.1">23</a> Nowadays pigeons (<i lang="njh">vephu</i>) are kept by a few people. Ducks are never kept, though large numbers are brought
up from the plains for food.

<h3 class="main"><i>Hunting.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Guns being comparatively scarce, the Lhota still hunts deer with dogs and spear as
his forefathers did before him. Sambhur (<i lang="njh">sepu</i>) are chiefly found in the flat river valleys, <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>and when hunted invariably make for the water, which they cross and recross repeatedly.
Tracks having shown that a sambhur is in a certain piece of jungle, the dogs are worked
through it by their owner, who encourages them with a shout like a loud laugh. With
him goes a thin line of spearmen to guard against a break back, while other spears
wait at places where the quarry is likely to cross the stream. The dogs give tongue
lustily enough as soon as they pick up the scent, so that the waiting spearmen can
change their position according to the line which the deer seems to be taking. This
goes on till the deer is either killed or gets clean away. The method of hunting serow
(<i lang="njh">tsiyo</i>) and barking deer (<i lang="njh">sanu</i>) is the same, except that these animals are found in the little valleys running down
the hills and are ambushed at the points where they try to get through into the next
valley. The Lhota is a wonderful judge of the line a deer is going to take and can
generally be relied upon to get his spear into a running target at twenty yards, so
that these hunts are more often successful than unsuccessful. No hunting takes place
on the day on which anyone has died in the village, not apparently from any idea of
showing respect to the dead, but because it is regarded as a foregone conclusion that
luck will be bad that day. If an animal killed is found to have died with its tongue
hanging out of the left side of its mouth, hunting is probably stopped for the day,
as it is believed that no more game will be killed; but to find the tongue hanging
out of the right side of the mouth means that if the hunters go on they will rouse
and kill another deer. <i lang="njh">Sityingo</i><a class="noteRef" id="n64.1src" href="#n64.1">24</a> is the jungle deity who owns all wild animals as a man owns domestic animals. If
a hunting party kills a deer with a torn ear they will hunt no more that day, for
have they not killed a deer whose ear <i lang="njh">Sityingo</i> has snicked as a sign of ownership. The deer, however, can be eaten. Furthermore,
the dogs must be purified before they can hunt again. Their owner orders his wife
to prepare a little “madhu.” This she must do in silence. Next day no stranger from
another village may enter his house, nor anyone who is doing <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>a “genna” of any kind. The following day water is added to the “madhu” and the “madhu”
rice given to the dogs to eat. The owner, taking them with him, goes with an old man
to a spot outside the village, where the latter makes a fire with a fire-stick, and
lifting the dogs in his hands passes them through the smoke, uttering as he does so
the following prayer to <i lang="njh">Sityingo</i>: “We have made new ‘madhu’ and new fire, and have purified the dogs. May all the
deer wherever they be come to our village and be hunted by these dogs.” He then watches
to see what insects come near the fire. If big insects come the dogs will get sambhur.
If small insects come they will get barking deer.
</p>
<p>Much though he enjoys the sport, the Lhota hunts primarily to get meat. The division
of the spoil is therefore carefully regulated by custom, which is strictly adhered
to. In the case of deer the first spear gets a hind-leg, second spear a fore-leg,
and the owner of the dogs a hind-leg, the head, liver and heart,<a class="noteRef" id="n65.1src" href="#n65.1">25</a> the remaining fore-leg going to the oldest man of the hunting party. The rest of
the meat is divided among the remaining spearmen, the older men getting slightly bigger
shares than the younger. A spear which only hits the animal in the face or on the
hock does not count. Were the thrower to claim a share of the meat on the strength
of such a hit it is believed that either he or one of his family would die. From every
deer killed <i lang="njh">Sityingo</i> is given his share. This consists of six little bits of liver wrapped in one leaf
and five little bits in another. These are eaten by the oldest man in the village
of the clan of the owner of the dogs. Wild pig (<i lang="njh">oni</i> or <i lang="njh">lipung</i>) are occasionally hunted with dogs, but generally are only speared if a man happens
to meet one. The same applies to bears (<i lang="njh">sivan</i>). A wounded bear is not generally followed up till next day. It is then relentlessly
tracked, alike over soft ground where every footprint is plain and over rocky slopes
where nothing but a few bent leaves show which <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>way it has gone, for a Lhota will pick up what, to European eyes, is a hardly perceptible
trail as easily and quickly as he will follow an ordinary path. In the case of animals
such as pig and bear killed without the aid of dogs, the first spear gets the head,
hind-leg, fore-leg, liver and heart, and the second spear the other fore-leg and hind-leg.
Remaining members of the party take the rest of the meat. There are no chiefs as there
are among the Semas and Changs to get a share of the meat whether they join in the
hunt or not. Dogs are also used to hunt porcupines (<i lang="njh">liso</i>), an animal much sought after for its flesh, the skin of the back being especially
esteemed. For a tiger (<i lang="njh">mharr</i>) or leopard (<i lang="njh">mharrtero</i>) hunt the whole male population of the village turns out with daos and shields and
spears, and, in Moilang and its neighbours, wearing cane helmets. A rough circle is
cleared round the piece of jungle in which the beast has been marked down, and a <span class="sans">V</span>-shaped palisade is built at the bottom. Outside this the old men wait with their
spears ready poised, while the young men drive the animal downhill, cutting the jungle
as they go. Any man who is charged falls with his shield over him, while a shower
of spears distracts the tiger’s attention. Eventually if all goes well the tiger is
driven into the palisading and speared by the old men waiting there. If a tiger happens
to break a spear the shaft must either be left in the jungle or stuck in the ground
under the head of the quarry when it is hung up after a successful hunt. If this is
not done the owner will some day be killed by a tiger. The tiger’s head is cut off
by a man who has done all social “gennas” and is a warrior of repute, and the paws
by a man who belongs to a family a member of which has been killed by a tiger. This
in a sense removes the curse from the family.<a class="noteRef" id="n66.1src" href="#n66.1">26</a> The head and paws are hung on a tree by the side of the path up to the village, and
<i lang="njh">tsombhondhro</i> leaves are stuffed in its mouth, some say to prevent it eating people in the Land
of the Dead, and some say so that it may not be able to tell the dead what clan killed
it. Under the head the hunters <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>jab the ground with their spear butts till it is thickly covered with little marks.
If the spirit (<i lang="njh">omon</i>) of the tiger comes wandering round it will see these marks and refrain from troubling
a village which possesses such a mighty army of warriors. The man who cut off the
tiger’s head must not eat beef, pork, goat’s flesh, jungle birds, taro or any boiled
relish, or have intercourse with his wife for twelve days. A similar prohibition for
one day applies to the other men of the village.
</p>
<p>Monkeys such as <i lang="la">Pithecus brahma</i> (<i lang="njh">otham</i>) and <i lang="la">Macacus assamensis</i> (<i lang="njh">kirango</i>) are shot with the crossbow (<i lang="njh">olo</i>) and arrows, but a tailless ground-monkey (<i lang="la">Macacus arctoides</i>, Lhota <i lang="njh">mitham</i>) is driven with great success, the day’s bag sometimes totalling thirty or forty.
A troop which takes up its abode in a jungly gully flanked by cultivated fields is
doomed. All the men of the village surround the jungle, and a tunnel (<i lang="njh">vaksap</i>) is built of interlaced jungle and brushwood at the lower end, like a duck-decoy
tunnel on a small scale. The monkeys are driven from the upper end, and keeping to
the ground enter the tunnel. Finding no exit at the lower end they completely lose
their heads and cling to one another and whimper till they are killed.
</p>
<p>Before the making of pitfalls (<i lang="njh">soku</i>) was forbidden by Government large numbers of elephants, deer and wild pig were killed
by means of them. Elephant-pits were huge affairs, but the ordinary pitfall was about
ten feet deep, with the bottom covered with big jagged rocks and “panjis,” so that
any animal which fell in was likely both to have its legs broken and to be impaled.
Many kinds of snares are used, mostly for small animals and birds, though a running
noose (<i lang="njh">putha</i> or <i lang="njh">ozo</i>) used to be used by the Southern Lhotas for deer. The commonest trap is the triangular
trap (<i lang="njh">tsiri</i>), which is also used by Aos, Changs, Semas and Angamis. It is set in runs or at holes
in fences and is most effective. It consists of a triangle of bamboo, the base of
which is extended to form a bow. The side nearest the bow is double. Through this
is passed a noose which is set in such a way that any animal or bird trying to get
through the triangle releases the bow and is caught by the noose <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>against the double side. Birds and small animals are also caught by running nooses
(<i lang="njh">khükcha</i>), platforms which release nooses when trodden on (<i lang="njh">chambo</i>), and fall-traps (<i lang="njh">otyo</i>). Are Yanthamo appears to be the only village which possesses a box-trap for leopards,
though these contrivances are common among the Aos, from whom Are Yanthamo probably
copied the one in question. It consists of a small low shed made of stout saplings
securely tied in place and is divided into two compartments, in the hinder of which
is put the bait, a live goat. The leopard enters, and in making for the goat treads
on a little platform which releases a catch and drops a heavy wooden door behind it.
Only once did a leopard enter the Are Yanthamo trap, and then it raged and roared
in such an alarming way that the local Nimrods sat in the village and quaked, till
it eventually managed to break its way out. A monkey is not an easy beast to snare,
but a genius in Changbang invented a booby trap for monkeys which is said to have
been very successful. He watched the line which monkeys took when chased off his fields.
In their path he dug a pitfall, and over it at some height arranged a dry branch in
such a way that monkeys would be sure to run along it in their flight. He cut this
branch nearly through, so that the first monkey which used it snapped it off and came
to an untimely end in the pitfall. Kabuis use a similar trap for monkeys.<a class="noteRef" id="n68.1src" href="#n68.1">27</a> Bird-lime (<i lang="njh">onyi</i>) made of a mixture of the sap of the rubber tree (<i lang="njh">nitsütung</i>) and <i lang="la">Ficus religiosa</i> (<i lang="njh">nitsotung</i>) is extensively used. The two kinds of sap are boiled down in separate “chungas,”
which are then split and the resulting rubber-like cakes extracted and cut into small
pieces. The bits of thickened <i lang="njh">nitso</i> sap are chewed to soften them and put in a broken potsherd. Then the pieces of <i lang="njh">nitsü</i> juice are toasted over the fire on the end of an old umbrella stay and mixed with
the <i lang="njh">nitso</i> sap in the potsherd while they are hot. The resulting bird-lime is sometimes put
on twigs stuck up by the side of pools at which birds come to drink, and sometimes
put on twigs fixed on bushes and baited with a live cockroach impaled on a thorn.
The use of decoy birds is <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>unknown. An accurate knowledge of its habits enables a snarer to catch even the Great
Indian Hornbill (<i lang="njh">rücheng</i>) with bird-lime. This bird never flies straight to the berries on which it is going
to feed, but always first perches on the thick part of the branch and then hops out
towards the end, raising its wings slightly at each hop. Limed twigs are therefore
put along the side of the branch at such an angle that they will touch the bird’s
body as it raises its wings. At such a touch it shuts its wing down on the limed twig
and is helpless.
</p>
<p>A word on the taking of bees’ and hornets’ nests may find a place under this section.
There are men who for some curious reason appear to be immune from stings, but the
ordinary Lhota either smokes out the nest he wishes to take, or else kills all the
occupants by taking a handful of the pounded skin of the chalmăgra fruit (<i lang="njh">hmhmti</i>) and blowing the fumes into the hole.<a class="noteRef" id="n69.1src" href="#n69.1">28</a> Honey or the juice of the pounded leaves and bark of a certain tree (<i lang="njh">tsungnung</i>) is often rubbed on the body as a protection against bee stings. A man who intends
to take a bees’ or hornets’ nest must remain chaste the night before. Both the honey
and grubs are eaten, and a species of large bee (<i lang="njh">tsakmen</i>) which builds under overhanging rocks and branches makes good wax. The other principal
species are a medium-sized bee (<i lang="njh">takrhi</i>), a small bee with a negligible sting (<i lang="njh">ndhrontso</i>) and a very small bee with a severe sting (<i lang="njh">lungtsak</i>). Hornets’ nests, which are sought for for the fat, juicy grubs they contain, are
not so easily taken. The nest of one species (<i lang="njh">tsaktsü</i>) is underground and the tiny hole by which it is entered is hard to find. Anyone,
therefore, who has a craving for <i lang="njh">tsaktsü</i> grubs puts out a bit of bad meat as a bait and catches the first hornet which settles
on it. He carefully extracts its sting and ties a bit of cotton-wool or a white feather
to its legs and lets it go. Hampered by the feather, which can be seen from a good
distance, it flies slowly towards home and can generally be followed if the jungle
is not too <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>thick. The nest once found a big fire is lighted over it at night when all the hornets
have gone in and it is dug out. Another kind of hornet (<i lang="njh">chengkuku</i>) with a red head and a fearful sting builds huge nests in the branches of trees.
At night a fire is lighted underneath and burning straw held to the nest at the end
of a bamboo. Any hornets which escape the burning straw drop into the fire and the
nest can be safely taken.
</p>
<p>Though Lhotas possess a wonderful sense of direction, it sometimes happens that a
man out hunting loses his way in the jungle. Should this happen he cuts a stick and
makes a few cuts in the bark to represent the pattern on a python’s skin. This stick
he leaves on the ground and is then sure to be able to find his way without difficulty.
The custom is connected with the belief that the python has a habit of leaving its
saliva on leaves, and that anyone who touches one of these leaves by accident will
go mad and lose his way.<a class="noteRef" id="n70.1src" href="#n70.1">29</a>

<h3 class="main"><i>Fishing.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Lhotas are keen fishermen and expert swimmers. Fishing rights over any particular
stretch of water are governed by custom, being held by the village or villages who
exercised them in the past. The rights to “poison” in any particular pool are generally
held jointly by two or more villages, while each village has the right to erect weirs
in particular stretches of water. “Poisoning” is by far the most important method
of fishing. Formerly the root of a small plant called <i lang="njh">notsü</i> was much used. The juice of this kills every fish with which it comes in contact
and its use has been prohibited by Government. The other so-called “poisons” only
stupefy the fish. The commonest is the juice of a creeper (<i lang="njh">niro</i>), which for some reason affects cat-fish (<i lang="njh">zyümo</i>) even when it is too weak to stupefy other fish. On one occasion when the writer
watched the fishing <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>of a pool insufficient poison was used. Yet thirty-six huge cat-fish were caught,
while the rest of the bag consisted of only about a dozen small fish.<a class="noteRef" id="n71.1src" href="#n71.1">30</a> Other “poisons” used are <i lang="njh">cheti</i> (the berries of a tree with leaves rather like mahogany leaves: this poison is much
used by the Aos, who call it <i lang="njh">arr</i>), <i lang="njh">pitsü</i> (a creeper with small leaves), <i lang="njh">opyak</i> and <i lang="njh">achak</i> (the bark of two species of trees), <i lang="njh">mwemti</i> (little berries, chiefly used in small streams), and <i lang="njh">mozi</i> (a creeper, weak and not much used). All the villages who have the right to “poison”
in a certain pool agree to combine to do so on a certain day. On the night before
the fishing is to take place sexual intercourse is forbidden, nor may anything be
killed in the morning before going down to the water. The presence of women is absolutely
forbidden when fishing is going on. Every man brings with him a bundle of creeper
(assuming <i lang="njh">niro</i> is being used). This is first thoroughly pounded on the bank to ensure that all the
cells are broken. Trees are felled and placed on rough stone supports across the stream
to serve as pounding benches for the final pounding, each village making its own line
or lines of benches one above the other. As each bench is finished the men lay their
half-pounded bundles of creeper on it. The braves then line up on the shore facing
up stream, and all ho-ho together and brandish their daos. Then a rush is made for
the benches and everyone pounds his bunch of creeper, dipping it in the water at intervals.
All chant as they work, and the men on each line of benches pound more or less in
time. Meanwhile old men are watching the <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>pool below and a shout goes up when the first fish is seen to come floundering to
the top. This is the signal for all to throw their bundles of creeper into the water
and rush down to the pool. Some wait round the edge with long-handled landing nets,
while others put a heavy stone into their “lengta” band and chase the fish at the
bottom of the pool, slipping the stone out when they want to come to the top. The
young bucks are like otters, and it is a common sight to see a man come up with a
fish in his teeth and one in each hand. Cat-fish are great prizes. They are often
heavier than a man and require all a man’s strength to drag to the top. Indeed it
is by no means uncommon for a Lhota to struggle with one of these enormous fish at
the bottom till he is exhausted and drowned. When anyone has landed a cat-fish he
cuts it with his dao in such a way that he will be able to recognize it and claim
his share when the catch is divided up. Small fish he strings on a slip of bamboo
at his waist. Every man who lands a cat-fish gets a specially big cut from it, but
the fish found in their stomachs are only eaten by old people. Otherwise the whole
catch of a village is divided up among the members who came down to fish according
to their age and importance. Whether they came down or not a share is given to the
<i lang="njh">Puthi</i> and anyone whose house has ever been “apotia.”<a class="noteRef" id="n72.1src" href="#n72.1">31</a>

<p>Fish-traps are of various kinds. The most elaborate is that called <i lang="njh">osa</i>, which is used on the Doyang and consists of a <span class="sans">V</span>-shaped bamboo weir pointing down-stream, with a long spout-like outlet, closed with
stakes set closely together, and roofed at the end so that fish cannot jump out. The
floor of the outlet is covered with bamboos laid lengthways, so that a fish once caught
in the rush of water can get no grip to work up-stream, but is held by the current
against the stakes at the bottom. Another type, also called <i lang="njh">osa</i>, is used on smaller streams and consists of a semicircular weir of bamboo or piled-up
stones, with gaps at intervals, each gap being blocked with a strong bamboo basket
from which, if a fish is once swept in, it cannot escape against the stream. This
kind of trap is particularly successful if <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>otters fishing in the pool above drive the fish down, a curious parallel to the way
in which Biscayan sardine fishers used to depend on porpoises to drive the shoals
of sardines into their nets. A third type used on moderate-sized streams is called
<i lang="njh">eyinga</i>. This consists of a bamboo weir right across the river and another weir with a big
opening in the middle about twenty yards lower down. Fish feeding their way up-stream
in the evening pass through the gap, which is closed at night, shutting the fish in.
A rough inner fence of bamboo is built along the lower weir, and the fish trying to
jump over on their return down-stream are caught between the two fences. Fish weirs
are in operation throughout the cold weather, till they are swept away by the first
big flood. The task of building a weir is not one which can be entered upon without
due precautions. For three days beforehand the builder must not speak to strangers
and must refrain from sexual intercourse. On the last morning neither he nor any of
the men who are to help him may kill anything, and the working party while engaged
on their task may speak to each other but to no one else at all, whether of their
own village or not. A man begins by helping his father, or one of his father’s friends,
when he is a boy, and gradually grows up to be the owner or joint owner of a weir
himself. Were a man who had never done so before to take it into his head to go down
and build a fish-trap he would surely die. When he was sleeping near his trap at night
the deity of the stream, the Water Master (<i lang="njh">Tchhüpfuo</i>), would come along and look at the soles of his feet and see that they were not white
like the soles of men who spend much time in the water. Then he would cause illness
to come upon him so that he would die. In a few villages a small hand-trap (<i lang="njh">naching</i>) is set in swampy pools for mud-fish. It consists of a small bamboo basket entered
by an inverted funnel, so that a fish once in cannot find the way out. When the rivers
are high fishing-rods (<i lang="njh">ngoko</i>) made of bamboo are used, with a line made of twisted <i lang="njh">chütsung</i> bark, the bark used for bow-strings. Hooks (<i lang="njh">mukhu</i>) are either bought at a shop or made out of umbrella wire. It is unlucky to catch
a kind of fish called <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span><i lang="njh">süwo</i> with the rod and line. Anyone who does so splits the fish in half lengthways and
lays the two halves on the ground. He then goes home by a road other than the road
by which he came. Were he to go home by the road he came he would meet and be killed
by a tiger or leopard. This fish can be eaten without any precautions if it is caught
in any other way. Where a stream is divided into two channels with an island in the
middle, one channel is often blocked with a temporary weir and all the water diverted
down the other. The fish in the blocked channel can then be caught by hand. When a
stream is both cold and highly coloured the fish appear to lose their vitality and
large numbers are caught by hand in holes and cracks.<a class="noteRef" id="n74.1src" href="#n74.1">32</a>

<h3 class="main"><i>Food.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Rice is the staple food, but some relish, even if it be only jungle leaves boiled
with chilies and salt, is always eaten with it. Meat is preferred if obtainable, but
the Lhota will eat most things at a pinch. His diet includes the meat of all domestic
animals and most wild animals and birds, fish, both fresh and dried, bee and hornet
grubs, large spiders, a kind of beetle, white ants, cultivated plants and innumerable
jungle leaves and berries. Certain things are forbidden, but villages near the plains
are much less particular in this respect than those on the inner ranges. The general
reason why certain animals and birds are not eaten is either that they are obviously
unclean or because they are thought likely to impart their properties to the eater
or to his children. Generally speaking old people can eat things which young people
cannot, because it does not much matter what happens to them and in any case they
will have no more children. Tigers and leopards are absolutely forbidden to all because
they eat men. Leopard cats can be eaten by old people who no longer cultivate. Were
a young man to eat it he would get poor crops. Wild dog <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>if eaten causes a raging thirst. Phiyosao of Akuk ate only a little of the skin of
one, but he had to leave the village school because he could never sit through a lesson
without going out for a drink. Whoever eats or even kills an otter will never be able
to get his fields to burn properly.<a class="noteRef" id="n75.1src" href="#n75.1">33</a> None but very old people may touch, much less eat, either the big or little flying
squirrel (<i lang="la">Petaurista yunnanensis</i> and <i lang="la">Pteromys aboniger</i>). Anyone who does so will frequently be guilty of indecent behaviour with the opposite
sex of his own clan. Several kinds of birds are forbidden. The Large Streaked Spiderhunter
(<i lang="la">Arachnothera magna</i>) is only eaten by very old people “because it is such a very funny-looking bird,
and has such a very long beak.” The local species of minivet (<i lang="la">Pericrocotus brevirostris</i>) is forbidden to all because the cocks are supposed to have got their scarlet markings
from being splashed with human blood. The Velvet-fronted Blue Nuthatch (<i lang="la">Sitta frontalis</i>) goes about in little flocks and is such a confiding little bird that if one is killed
the rest of the flock will wait near till they are killed too. Therefore if a man
were to eat one, one death in his household would be followed by a series of deaths.
A solitary old man or woman can, of course, eat this bird with impunity. The Whitecapped
Redstart (<i lang="la">Chimarrhornis leucocephalus</i>) and Whiteheaded Babbler (<i lang="la">Gampsorhynchus rufulus</i>) are not eaten because they would cause the eater to become grey-headed. Parrots
and crow-tits (<i lang="la">Parodoxornis</i>) are not eaten because of the shape of their beaks. The eater’s children would be
everlastingly pinching their friends. Scimitar babblers (<i lang="la">Pomatorhinus</i>) if eaten would make the eater unable to remember his dreams and so deprive him of
an important guide in life. The clan of anyone who ate a sun-bird (<i lang="la">Æthopyga</i>) would dwindle in numbers, for sun-birds used to be as big as fowls, but are now
the smallest of all birds. Swiftlets and swallows are <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>never still. The children of anyone who ate the flesh of these birds would be idle
and always wanting to run about and play. The flesh of the Tree or House Sparrow is
said to cause the itch. The Red-headed Trogon (<i lang="la">Harpactes erythrocephalus</i>) is not eaten because it is supposed to have got its brilliant colouring from human
blood. Owlets (<i>Scops</i>) are not eaten owing to the extraordinary belief that they hatch their eggs by lying
on their backs on them. The nightjar when disturbed only flies a short way and then
settles on the ground again as if inviting one to follow. In this way it used to lead
men on and on like a will-o’-the-wisp till they found themselves in an ambush and
were killed. Therefore nightjars are not eaten. The Green Magpie (<i lang="la">Cissa chinensis</i>) is not eaten owing to a supposed habit of sitting on the bamboo erections built
over graves. The loud laughing cry of the Himalayan White-crested Laughing Thrush
(<i lang="la">Garrulax leucolophas</i>) is particularly sudden and startling. Were a man to eat its flesh he would become
nervous in the jungle and would jump whenever a twig or a leaf dropped near him. The
cry of the Long-tailed Broadbill (<i lang="la">Psarisomus dalhousiæ</i>) is a sign of rain, and whoever eats its flesh will always have bad weather when
he goes to work in his fields. The hoopoe is such a curious bird that to eat it might
mean disaster to the clan. Hawks are continually dropping excreta. Whoever ate one
would spit continually.<a class="noteRef" id="n76.1src" href="#n76.1">34</a> The Rufous-bellied Hawk Eagle (<i lang="la">Lophotriorchis kieneri</i>) is forbidden to all but old people who expect to have no more children, for sores
appear on the heads of the eater’s children. The two species of Racket-tailed Drongo
(<i lang="la">Dissemurus paradiseus</i> and <i lang="la">Bhringa remifer</i>) are only eaten by old people, for as they have two very long conspicuous tail-feathers,
so whoever ate their flesh would only have two children. The Indian Roller, commonly
called the Blue Jay, is only eaten by old people, for the children of the eater would
be as noisy as the bird itself. Ashy Swallow-Shrikes (<i lang="la">Artamus fuscus</i>) have a habit of sitting on branches in rows, each bird touching its neighbour. <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>It is therefore eaten by none but very old people, for were any young man or woman
to eat it he or she would never be able to sit alone, but would always want to go
and sit cuddled up against one of the other sex, a habit full of possibilities of
trouble. The flesh of the Great Indian Hornbill (<i lang="la">Dichoceros bicornis</i>) is absolutely forbidden to members of the Tompyaktserre phratry, and is very rarely
eaten by members of other phratries. The bird has a croaking note, and were a man
to whom its flesh is forbidden to eat it he would die of violent hiccoughs. Of reptiles
the python is eaten by all in the villages near the plains, but elsewhere it is only
eaten by old people. (Even villages near the plains never speak of it as “python”
(<i lang="njh">ongam</i>) when talking of it as an article of diet, but always call it by the politer name
of <i lang="njh">sosiyo</i>, “long meat.”) It is believed that black marks are liable to appear on the back of
the eater, who will be semi-paralysed and only able to move his body slowly like a
python. A Rephyim man called Lobenthang is supposed to have been affected in this
way. Snakes other than the python are forbidden to all. Old women may eat the same
things as old men, but there are a few kinds of meat which men may eat, but young
and middle-aged women may not. These include serow, wild mithan, buffalo, bear, elephant,
monkey, white-browed gibbon (“huluk”) and pangolin. Most of these are forbidden for
no reason which is known now,<a class="noteRef" id="n77.1src" href="#n77.1">35</a> but gibbon is prohibited because these animals are supposed to have no more than
a single young one once in nine years, and this peculiarity would assuredly pass to
the eater. In some villages these prohibitions are only observed at the time of pregnancy.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>Rice is invariably cooked separately from the meat or whatever is to be eaten with
it. Meat and vegetables are boiled together with a lavish allowance of chilies and
salt. Practically all food is boiled, though maize is roasted and eaten cold and plantains
are roasted in their skins. A very favourite relish is bamboo pickle (<i lang="njh">dhrüchong</i>) made of the hearts of young bamboo shoots pounded up with water and then dried,
and boiled again when required. Though the Lhota prefers his food fresh he will eat
both meat and fish which is pretty far gone. The flesh, entrails, blood and skin of
an animal are eaten—in fact, practically everything except the hair. The men who went
to France with the Naga Labour Corps thought our method of cleaning an animal and
throwing away the offal most wasteful. Meat is stored by cutting it into small pieces
and smoking it over the fire. In this way it will keep for a year.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To deprive a Lhota of his “madhu” (<i lang="njh">soko</i>) would be like depriving a British workman of both his beer and tea. The Lhota only
drinks water if he can get nothing else. He drinks “madhu” both at meals and between
meals. It is made as follows. Rice is boiled in the ordinary way and spread on a mat
to cool. A cake of yeast (<i lang="njh">vamhe</i>) is then broken up and well mixed with it, and the rice put to ferment in a basket
lined with leaves. Next day the liquor begins to run off and is collected in a bamboo
“chunga.” This is <i lang="njh">zutsü</i> (Assamese “rohi”), the most potent form of “madhu.” When new it is the colour of
rather greenish water. If kept it will remain good for five or six months, gradually
<span class="corr" id="xd31e4227" title="Source: increasng">increasing</span> in strength and turning a pale sherry colour. It is this form of “madhu” which is
always offered to guests of importance. In some villages of the Northern Lhotas the
rice is not put into a basket to ferment, but into a vat, a hollow section of bamboo
being placed upright in it to collect the <i lang="njh">zutsü</i>, which is allowed to drain off for three days. The fermented rice from which the
<i lang="njh">zutsü</i> has been drained off is put into a “madhu-sieve” (<i lang="njh">cham</i>) and hot or sometimes cold water is <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>poured on to it. It is well kneaded, and the resulting brew is <i lang="njh">chemcho</i> (Assamese “saka madhu”), the usual Lhota drink, and is of about the potency of light
beer. Sometimes, especially among the Southern Lhotas, millet, giant millet or Job’s
tears, or a mixture of maize and rice, is used instead of rice for making “madhu.”
The yeast is made as follows. Rice is ground into flour and wetted and kneaded into
dough. To this a little old yeast is added, and either the water from crushed <i lang="njh">phyushako</i> bark, or from the crushed leaves of <i lang="njh">yimerhe</i> or <i lang="njh">shingwo</i>. The dough with this added is again well kneaded and divided into cakes about the
size of penny buns. These dry of themselves and remain good for six or seven months.
</p>
<p>The mild form of rice beer called in Assamese “pita madhu,” which is so popular among
the Angamis, is hardly made by the Lhotas except at harvest. A little unhusked rice
is kept damp until it sprouts, and is then dried. Husked rice is ground into flour
and put into a vat with hot water. Next day when it has become cold the dried sprouted
rice is ground up and mixed with a little yeast and added to the water. This ferments
and is ready for drinking next day. It is drunk diluted with water and is called <i lang="njh">etha soko</i>.

<h3 class="main"><i>Medicine.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Illness is generally ascribed to evil spirits (<i lang="njh">tsandhramo</i>) or the wandering of the patient’s soul (<i lang="njh">omon</i>), who accordingly calls in a medicine man (<i lang="njh">ratsen</i>) to extract from his body the bit of earth or wood or hair which the evil spirit
put there, or causes a ceremony to be performed to call back his soul. A few medicines
are, however, known. Fat pork is eaten as an aperient. For an emetic, chicken dung
and rat dung are whipped up with water and the mixture is drunk—probably as effective
an emetic as any known to science. For diarrhœa the remedies are roasted goat’s hoof
or the gall of either cow or pig. For stomach-ache and intestinal worms an infusion
of the bark of <i lang="njh">nshitong</i> (<i lang="la">Stereospernum chelonoides</i>) is drunk. For indigestion and stomach troubles <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>in general a little of the dried upper stomach of the porcupine is ground up and taken
mixed with water, or a poultice of wild lemon leaves (<i lang="njh">tsoshü</i>) or the crushed leaves of <i lang="la">Maesa indica</i> (<i lang="njh">tsandhrammozü</i>, lit. “devil’s medicine”) is put over the affected part. For a cough the green pentagonal-shaped
berries of the <i lang="njh">yenkuti</i> tree are chewed, or a berry called <i lang="njh">riko</i> is ground up and taken with “rohi madhu.” The <i lang="njh">yenkuti</i> berry is also used as a tonic for weak children. Bat’s flesh is another tonic for
children whose mothers cannot suckle them properly. For headache the leaf of the <i lang="njh">kizu</i> tree (<i lang="la">Bischoffia javanica</i>) is laid on the forehead. For wounds the commonest remedy is a poultice of the ground-up
bark of young shoots of the <i lang="njh">nungnung</i> tree (<i lang="la">Callicarpa arborea roxb.</i>, fam. <i lang="la">Verbenaceæ</i>). This has the effect of stopping bleeding. The mashed-up leaves of the <i lang="njh">pontengcho</i> tree have the same effect. A bush called <i lang="njh">temphak</i> (<i lang="la">Rhus semialata</i>) provides two medicines. The juice of the berries is a cure for stomach-ache, and
a cooling lotion for use in cases of chicken pox and smallpox is prepared from the
pounded leaves. The gall of the python is said to cure fever and intestinal troubles.
A lotion made from <i lang="la">Taraktogenos kurzii</i> (<i lang="njh">hmhmti</i>) bark is used to disinfect wounds. If maggots get into a wound in an animal a mash
of pounded giant woodlouse (<i lang="njh">sharhi</i>) is applied. Soot (<i lang="njh">live</i>) is applied for skin diseases. For burns the ash of the leaves of the <i lang="njh">woropentung</i> tree is applied. For dog-bite a whisker of the dog which bit the man is singed and
put on the wound. Another example of the “hair of the dog” is the practice of drinking
very hot “rohi madhu” as a remedy for drunkenness. To bring a boil to a head a little
yeast (<i lang="njh">vamhe</i>) is damped and rubbed over it. When ready it is lanced with a sharp splinter of bamboo.
To get rid of warts a black-and-yellow beetle called <i lang="njh">potso tsiro</i> (“god’s mithan”) is crushed on them. This causes them to fester and disappear. Goître
is not common except in Are. When it occurs it is regarded as being due to drinking
water from a spring near which plants with bulbous roots grow. The only known remedy
is to run a red-hot umbrella wire through the goître, but this heroic measure is rarely
employed. Most sufferers <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>prefer the disease to the cure. For soreness of the eyes the leaves of the <i lang="njh">mongsentung</i> are crushed up and held to the face so that the fumes reach the eye. For a sprain
of any kind the great remedy is to draw blood. In the case of slight sprains the affected
place is scratched and made to bleed and a leech put on to suck. For more serious
sprains or contusions the swelling is cupped. The instrument used is a serow horn.
The base is smoothed down so that it will lie closely against the skin, and a small
hole is bored near the tip of the horn, round which a thin, slightly withered leaf
is wrapped. The skin is pricked with a splinter of bamboo and the horn being placed
in position the blood is sucked up into it by the hole near the top. The thin leaf
allows the air to be sucked from the interior of the horn, but acts as an efficient
valve when the operator stops to take breath. This method of cupping is used for sprains,
bruises and dropsy, in fact in any case where it is desired to reduce a swelling.
In cases of snake-bite the limb affected is first tightly bound above the bite. An
infusion of the bark of a tree called <i lang="njh">nungatsung</i> is rubbed on the legs as a protection against leech-bites.

<p class="first">Home-grown tobacco is cured by drying the leaves in the sun for three or four days.
They are then stamped and rolled with the feet and again dried. The result is a coarse-smoking
tobacco, very hot to the tongue and difficult to keep alight. Hence the popularity
of cheap cigarettes among boys nowadays. The short pipe (<i lang="njh">tsintsanmukukhu</i>) is simply a short section of bamboo with a small bamboo tube stuck in the side of
it, a few lines being sometimes scratched on the bowl by way of ornamentation. The
big pipe (<i lang="njh">murimukukhu</i>) is a more elaborate affair, with a bowl cut out of soft black stone and set in a
wooden base forming one piece with the stem, which is bored with a hot iron and ends
in a small bamboo mouth-piece. From the bowl a small bamboo tube some four inches
long runs down through the wooden base into a section of bamboo about five inches
long. This is detachable and is kept full of <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>water when the pipe is in action. All the smoke is drawn through the water, which
becomes nothing but very dirty diluted nicotine. This foul liquid is carefully kept
and sipped now and again as a pick-me-up. If he does not take his big pipe with him
when he goes down to his fields a man will often take a little gourd of this stuff.
Though they are in such close touch with the plains, opium eating is unknown in Lhota
villages, a great contrast with the Aos and Konyaks. Betel nut is chewed with “pan”
and lime in the villages near the plains. Lime used to be made locally from the ground-up
shells of freshwater snails, but is now bought in the plains.
</p>
<p>A remarkable number of suicides by poisoning take place among the Lhotas. For this
the root of a common flowering plant called <i lang="njh">rhisa</i> is used. This poison has a very strong taste and cannot be given to another man without
his knowledge. Mixed with boiled rice it is used as rat poison. Tradition has it that
men of standing used to be poisoned by their enemies through the agency of old women
and children, and a man once told the writer that he was nearly poisoned in that way.
But no authentic case of murder by poisoning appears ever to have been known.<a class="noteRef" id="n82.1src" href="#n82.1">36</a>

<p class="first">Wrestling and running are not much indulged in, but both high jump (<i lang="njh">untsongeyen</i>) and long jump (<i lang="njh">eyenda</i>) are popular. For the former the competitors run straight at the jump and clear it
with their feet together, the “scissor” style of jumping being unknown. A good jumper
can clear a reed the height of his own chin. For the long jump a flat stone is put
in position to take off from, and the mark which counts is that made by the jumper’s
feet in landing, whether he falls backwards or not. For the “jump-and-kick” <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>(<i lang="njh">nshü</i>) the jumper makes a standing jump and while in the air kicks with both feet together
at some mark such as a leaf stuck on the end of an upright spear. It is quite common
for a man to be able to kick a mark as high above his head as he can reach with his
hand. A variety of this (<i lang="njh">choa­nshü</i>) is one in which the jumper takes a standing jump from one leg and kicks the mark
with the foot from which he jumped—a most difficult feat. Putting the weight (<i lang="njh">olungeyen</i>) is done either with one hand in the English manner or with both hands from above
the head.
</p>
<p>A game called <i lang="njh">khurocho</i> in which sides are taken is played with seeds like big flat chestnuts obtained from
the large bean-like pods of the sword bean (<i lang="njh">khuro</i>). These seeds are also the Lhota substitute for soap. The game is played at sowing
time on coming back to the village in the evening. There are generally three or four
players a side, though there may be as many as seven or eight. A number of seeds equal
to the number of players on each side are set up on edge in a row with their edges
touching. About three yards from them and parallel to them a line called <i lang="njh">epfu</i><a class="noteRef" id="n83.1src" href="#n83.1">37</a> is scratched on the ground. A yard behind <i lang="njh">epfu</i> another line called <i lang="njh">esi</i> is marked, and behind that at intervals of a yard two more lines called <i lang="njh">sichemo</i> and <i lang="njh">sikao</i>. Each side has an innings in turn, while the other side puts back the seeds which
are knocked out of place. Each member of the side which is in throws at the line in
turn with another seed and tries to knock away every seed in the line. The first throws
from <i lang="njh">epfu</i>, and if some member succeeds in knocking away all the seeds in the line, the side
moves back to <i lang="njh">esi</i> and throws from there, and so on to <i lang="njh">sikao</i>, from which it works back to <i lang="njh">sichemo</i>, <i lang="njh">esi</i> and <i lang="njh">epfu</i> and begins again, till it happens that no one in the side succeeds in knocking away
all the seeds, when the side is out and the other side comes in. A seed is not counted
as knocked out unless it is knocked at least a cubit from the line of seeds. The thrower
may stride forward as far as he likes provided his back foot is on the line from which
his side is throwing. This <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>game appears to resemble that known among the Manipuris as <i lang="njh">kang</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n84.1src" href="#n84.1">38</a>
</p>
<p>A game also called <i lang="njh">khurocho</i>, but entirely different though the same seeds are used, is played in Yimpang and
seems to be peculiar to that village.<a class="noteRef" id="n84.2src" href="#n84.2">39</a> The players are usually two a side. The seeds are laid in pairs one on the top of
another in two converging lines meeting in an apex about two yards from the mark at
which the spinner squats. The player holds a seed in the palm of his left hand and
with a flick of his right forefinger spins it at the lines of seeds. The object is
to knock as many of the top seeds off as possible. If a bottom seed of a pair is knocked
out of place it counts as a miss. One side uses one line and the other the other for
scoring their points, which is done with a bit of wood laid between the pairs to mark
the number of top seeds knocked off by that side. It does not matter from which line
they are knocked off, though the spinner must hit one or both of the two pairs nearest
him, and not break the line in the middle. Whichever side is able to move its mark
up from the bottom to the top of a line first wins.
</p>
<p>Tops (<i lang="njh">phiro</i>) shaped like double cones are made of hard wood. The string is wound round one cone
and the end held in the fingers. The top is then thrown either underhand or overhand
and the string jerked back while it is still in the air. The object is to knock over
someone else’s top which is already spinning. Tops are spun at and just after sowing
time. The Changs attach some special significance to top-spinning. All indulge in
the sport at and just after sowing, but a man who spins a top at any other time is
fined by his fellow-villagers. Lhotas inflict no fine, but the custom is that tops
should be spun only at the time mentioned. Another game, if game it can be called,
is a competition to see who can eat most fat pork and salt. Toys are unknown, though
little boys carry miniature bamboo spears in imitation of their fathers, and little
girls <span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>carry sticks or stones wrapped in a cloth on their backs as mother carries the baby.
Notches are often cut on the edges of the beds in the <i lang="njh">champo</i>, and little boys play a game (<i lang="njh">ekhirandhapen</i>) in which they say, “bom, bom,” as they touch each notch, beginning at the end of
the line, the object being to see how far you can get without taking a fresh breath.

<p class="first">Besides songs, of which some account has been given in the section on language, the
operations of reaping, threshing and carrying up the crop are accompanied by simple
wordless chants. Only the proper chant which tradition sanctions may be sung. Were
a man to use the wrong one, the reaping chant while threshing, for instance, the listening
spirits of the fields (<i lang="njh">Rangsi</i>) would be displeased and refuse him their blessings.
</p>
<p>Three varieties of musical instrument are used. Of these the simplest is the trumpet
(<i lang="njh">phupphu</i>), consisting merely of a bamboo tube about sixteen inches long, from which a bellowing
noise can be produced. A more elaborate type of <i lang="njh">phupphu</i> has a tube about four and a half feet long of light wood from which the pith has
been removed, terminating in a trumpet-shaped piece of gourd. The Lhota has an accurate
ear for music, and with this he can give wonderful imitations of bugle calls. But
the instrument upon which he is most expert is the flute (<i lang="njh">philili</i> or <i lang="njh">phiphili</i>). This consists of a thin bamboo tube about forty inches long, open at both ends,
with a small square mouthpiece cut about two inches from the thick end.<a class="noteRef" id="n85.1src" href="#n85.1">40</a> The player either sits down or lies on his back, with his right wrist resting on
the ground. With the palm or one of the fingers of his left hand he stops up the broad
end, and using the mouthpiece like that of a flute, produces a rather pleasing tootling
tune by opening or closing the small end with the middle finger of his right hand.
This instrument is a favourite one with young bucks, who lie on their backs in the
“morung” and tootle the names of their lady-loves in simple tunes. In <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>every village a particular combination of notes represents the name of each fair one,
and strange though it may seem, no one listening ever seems to have any doubt as to
what lady’s fame is being celebrated.

pot on to boil and open the door. After a meal all go down to the fields, taking with
them “madhu,” cold rice and some cooked meat or vegetables. This the family eat while
they take a short rest in the middle of the day in the field-house. The evening meal
is eaten when they come back from the fields. After that it is soon time for bed.
When the harvest is in there is less work, and men go away on short trading tours,
or make up hunting parties, while the women stay at home and weave and gossip.

result is that almost the only fish taken are a few labeo, a bottom-feeding fish more
susceptible to poison than mahseer, and any cat-fish (<i lang="la">Bagarius yarrellii</i> or <i lang="la">Silundia gangetica</i> or some similar Siluroid) that there may be in the river. Ultimately I came to the

the animal for destroying and wasting paddy will pass to the woman, who is responsible
for regulating the household consumption, and thereby cause the household store of
grain to be unduly depleted. This is almost certainly the reason in the case of the
monkey and might apply equally to the wild mithan and buffalo, to the bear and to
the elephant. It could hardly be applied to the serow or to the pangolin. The former
of these two is a roaming animal and rarely sleeps long in the same spot, which offers
an obvious reason for the prohibition. The pangolin is such a curious beast that anyone

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Lhota tribe may fairly be said to have an exogamous system which is in the process
of breaking down. There are three phratries divided into clans (<i lang="njh">chibo</i>) which are in some cases further split up into kindreds (<i lang="njh">mhitso</i>, lit. “tail”). Strictly speaking a man ought to take his wife from a phratry other
than his own. On this Lhota opinion is quite clear. On the other hand, marriage between
members of different clans is allowed everywhere and is especially common among the
Southern Lhotas, though it is viewed with a certain amount of disapproval by the conservative
members of the tribe. In some villages, again, chiefly among the Southern Lhotas,
marriage between members of different kindreds of the same clan is permitted. The
reason for these innovations—for innovations of the last three or four generations
they are believed to be—is that a man’s choice of a wife is limited, for he is almost
forced by circumstances to take one from his own village, or at any rate from a neighbouring
village. A man in search of a bride naturally thinks first of marriageable girls whom
he knows of near home. The parents of a girl, too, usually much prefer that she should
marry a man in their own village, sometimes because they are fond of her, but more
often because they want her to come in and give a helping hand in the house or look
after them when they are ill. The Lhota marriage-price system is another potent factor
in reducing a man’s field of choice. The bridegroom naturally does not want to go
and work for a father-in-law in a distant village where he will have to live <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>among strangers, with no chance of keeping an eye on his own fields and those of his
parents. The money part of the marriage price too is always paid in instalments and
never in a lump sum, for a father fears that were he to take a lump sum he would be
regarded as selling his daughter, as indeed he is to all intents and purposes. It
is therefore convenient to have a son-in-law close at hand, where his memory can be
conveniently jogged when instalments get overdue.
</p>
<p>The following are the phratries and clans of the tribe, the clans which are regarded
by Lhotas as having an extraneous origin being marked with an asterisk:—

<p>The three phratries, Tompyaktserre, Izumontserre and Mipongsandre, are said to be
descended from three brothers, Limhachan, Izumontse, and Rhankhantang, or Rankhanda,<a class="noteRef" id="n88.1src" href="#n88.1">1</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>who were the first men to come out of the earth. The origins of the different clans,
so far as tradition relates, are as follows. In the Tompyaktserre phratry, Pathong,
Chami and Tsoboi are said to have been the three sons of Kikung. Pathong is said to
have taken his father’s head at the instigation of a friend whose name is not recorded.
The Kikung clan claim a vague headship over the phratry, and say that in the good
old days they alone had the right to wear ivory armlets and keep mithan. The Ovung
and Tsangsükikung clans, the latter of which is found chiefly at Yimbang, are said
to be descended from “jungle men” caught by members of the Kikung clan long, long
ago. Chongyichami and Worore are regarded as closely related to the Chami clan, the
former being descended from Aos absorbed when the Lhotas invaded the Ao country. The
Worore or “bird clan” are particularly interesting. They are found only in Pangti,
the last Ao village taken over by the Lhotas, where tradition says that the two tribes
lived together for some time. The story of the origin of the clan is identical with
that told about the Ao “bird clan,” Wozakumrr, and there can be little doubt that
the Worore are really Aos who have been absorbed into the Lhota tribe. The story is
that a Chami woman was sitting weaving outside her house one day when a hornbill flew
over her head and dropped one of its tail feathers in her lap. She tucked the feather
into her waist, and by it became pregnant and bore a son who was the ancestor of the
Worore clan. Among the Aos no member of the Wozakumrr clan may kill a hornbill or
even see the dead body of one that has been killed. Nor may he eat its flesh or wear
its feathers till they are thoroughly dry. In common with the rest of the Tompyaktserre
phratry the Worore clan do not eat the flesh of the hornbill, but otherwise they are
under no special prohibition with regard to it. There appears to be no tradition relating
to the Kuwang clan, which is regarded as closely related to the Tsoboi clan, and is
often called Tsoboi-kuwang. The names of the two kindreds of the Ovung clan—Worosaeromo
and Worosanromo—mean respectively “those who make bird platforms” and “those who do
not make bird platforms.” <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>One kindred makes a little platform on which the cooking-pot and remains of the chicken
are left behind after a “genna” in the fields, and one does not. No reason is known
for this divergence of custom.
</p>
<p>The original clans of the Izumontserre phratry are Nguli, Shetri and Humtsoi, descended
from and named after three brothers. The Sempinguli clan is only found in a few villages
such as Pangti, Lungla, Yemkha and Lungithang, and is said to be descended from Sema
fugitives who attached themselves to the Nguli clan. The Sityingongnuli form another
small clan reputed to be descended from a “jungle man” caught in a snare. They have
the reputation of being expert snarers. The Mozoi clan is said to be descended from
another “jungle man” caught by some members of the Nguli clan who were “poisoning”
a river for fish. The Rangpang clan in turn is believed to be descended from a slave
or orphan brought up by one of the Mozoi clan, and is often called Mozoirangpang.
The origin of the Kithang clan is obscure. One tradition classes them as Izumontserre
and another as Tompyaktserre. They take wives from all clans but their own nowadays,
and have no tradition that any phratry was ever forbidden to them.
</p>
<p>In the Mipongsandre phratry the Muri and Othui clans are regarded as descendants of
two cousins named Muri and Othui who lived when the Lhotas were settled near Lazemi,<a class="noteRef" id="n90.1src" href="#n90.1">2</a> and were the great-great-great-great-grandsons of Longchethang, the first man to
dig himself out of the earth according to one tradition. The Eni clan is believed
to be descended from a slave or “jungle man” brought up by Othui. Thangwe in turn
are descended from a “jungle man” caught by Eni when he was in the jungle cutting
a species of bamboo called <i lang="njh">ticho</i>. It is believed that in the year when these bamboos seed and die a large number of
the Thangwe clan die. Members of the Thangwe clan are not prohibited from using these
bamboos in any way. The Lapung clan, which is practically confined to <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>Lotsü village, is regarded as closely akin to the Thangwe clan. The small Chorothui
clan originated as follows. An old man of the Othui clan<a class="noteRef" id="n91.1src" href="#n91.1">3</a> was in the act of sacrificing a pig, when on drawing back his spear for the thrust
the butt came in contact with someone behind. The old man looked round and found a
stranger standing watching. He took the stranger to his house and fed him, but the
only reply he could get to his questions as to whence he had come was the one word
“Chorocho”—“I came down,” <i>i.e.</i> from the sky. From this the name of the clan is derived. Ezong and Tsangle are regarded
as original clans, sprung from cousins or brothers of Muri and Othui. Yanthang means
“Rengma,” and the clan is descended from Rengmas who rejoined the Lhotas after the
two tribes had split up. The Moyoyanthang clan is only found in Lakhuti. Their ancestors
are said to have been a wandering band of Rengmas who were only allowed to settle
there on condition they never claimed any rights in the village. To this day they
can never provide a <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> and may not take any part in the dance at the building of a new “morung.” This is
a unique example among the Lhotas of a particular clan being regarded as of inferior
status. With this exception all clans have equal rights, whether they spring from
a supposed extraneous origin or not.
</p>
<p>The number of clans which tradition says sprang from “jungle men” (<i lang="njh">orakyon</i>) is remarkable. These “jungle men,” as the Lhota word literally means, are said to
have been like Nagas to look at. They are generally heard of in stories as being found
hiding in trees or stealing from traps. Possibly they represent aboriginal inhabitants
encountered by Nagas at some period of their migrations.
</p>
<p>Some clans are still undivided. Others have split up into two kindreds which intermarry
and call themselves “big” and “little,” <i>e.g.</i> Ezongterowe and Ezongtsopowe. Others, again, are divided into many kindreds, each
called after some ancestor. The following are among the kindreds <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>of the Nguli clan—Yemkhashandre, Yemphuhore, Ritsenshandre, Monglema, Pyakore, Yemtsore,
Shungentsore, Yamphentangre. Besides this arrangement of phratries, clans and kindreds
within the tribe there is a system of inter-tribal corresponding clans existing in
all the Naga tribes with which the writer is acquainted. A Lhota will say, for instance,
that his clan is “the same” as some particular Ao clan. That Ao clan in turn will
say that they are “one clan” with some particular Konyak clan, which in turn has a
corresponding Phom clan, and so on. For instance, Lhota Chami corresponds to Ao Chamirr
and Sema Yepothomi; Lhota Kikung corresponds to Ao Longchacharr, Sema Shohemi and
Rengma Apungza; Lhota Muri corresponds to Ao Pongrr and Sema Chishilimi; Lhoti Nguli
corresponds to Ao Alangcharr, Sema Wotsami<a class="noteRef" id="n92.1src" href="#n92.1">4</a> and Rengma Ketenini, and so on. A Sema who comes and settles in Are becomes a Lhota
and incorporates himself into the clan corresponding to his old clan. If he or his
children go back they slip into their old clan again. In cases where a Lhota marries
a woman of another tribe he may, however, take a wife from a corresponding clan. For
the clans being of different tribes they are regarded as being so widely separated,
though corresponding, that there is no harm in intermarriage. But it is quite possible
that intermarriage was once forbidden, <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>for Changs who keep old customs very strictly will not intermarry with a corresponding
Ao clan.

<p class="xd31e5537"><span class="sc">Note.</span>—For the sake of clearness only one word for mother (<i lang="njh">oyo</i>) has been given in the above list. But in speaking of women born in certain clans
the terms <i lang="njh">opfu</i>, <i lang="njh">opfuramo</i>, and <i lang="njh">opfununghowo</i> are invariably used instead of <i lang="njh">oyo</i>, <i lang="njh">oyoramo</i>, and <i lang="njh">oyonunghowo</i>, irrespective of what clan <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>their husbands may belong to. These clans are all the clans of the Tompyaktserre phratry,
and the Ezong clan of the Mipongsandre phratry. In speaking of women of the Nguli,
Kithang, Sempinguli, Sityingonguli, Shetri and Humtsoi clans the Northern Lhotas use
<i lang="njh">oyo</i> and its derivatives, while the Southern Lhotas use <i lang="njh">opfu</i> and its derivatives. The custom with regard to women of the Yanthang, Moyoyanthang
and Tsangle clans varies in different villages. The Lhotas cannot account for the
existence of two terms for ‘mother,’ nor can they say why a particular term is used
in speaking of women born in a particular clan.<a class="noteRef" id="n95.1src" href="#n95.1">5</a>
</p>
<p>In ordinary conversation the general <i lang="njh">ongo</i>, boy, and <i lang="njh">oka</i>, lass, are used instead of the formal terms <i lang="njh">otsotyungo</i> and <i lang="njh">otsolovo</i>. In the case of a woman speaking of her brother’s child <i lang="njh">ongo</i> and <i lang="njh">oka</i> are invariably used instead of <i lang="njh">otsotyungo</i> and <i lang="njh">otsolovo</i> in order to avoid any suggestion of marital relations with her brother. The terms
<i lang="njh">orapfu</i> and <i lang="njh">eng</i> are rarely used in address, or when a man or woman is speaking of his or her own
wife or husband. Instead, <i lang="njh">okikhamo</i> (m.) and <i lang="njh">okikhamm</i> (f.), meaning “house-mate,” are substituted.
</p>
<p>Though they may be of a different phratry there are certain women whom a man may not
marry. (1) His mother’s sister’s daughter, even if his mother’s sister has married
into another clan, for he calls his mother’s sister <i lang="njh">oyoramo</i> (“big mother”) or <i lang="njh">oyonunghowo</i> (“little mother”); (2) his own sister’s daughter (<i lang="njh">orrhovo</i>); (3) his father’s sister’s daughter (<i lang="njh">orrhovo</i>); but he can marry his mother’s brother’s daughter (<i lang="njh">oyonunghowo</i>). A man is rather expected to take his wife from his mother’s clan. There is no fine
for not doing so, but his mother’s clan are likely to take offence. He is fined if,
having taken one wife from his mother’s clan, he takes a new one from another clan.
The fine amounts to about Rs. 5, and is called <i lang="njh">lolang ’ntyakma</i> (the price of not taking from the mother’s clan). A man is not bound to marry his
deceased brother’s wife, but he may do so if he wishes without paying any marriage
price. He may also marry his father’s widow provided that she is not his own mother,
but such marriages, though pretty common, are viewed with a certain amount of disfavour.<a class="noteRef" id="n95.2src" href="#n95.2">6</a>

<h3 class="main"><i>Polity and Village Organization.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Every village is an independent unit in the tribe. Leagues of villages were formed
for purposes of war, and in these cases the advice of the most powerful village would
naturally carry most weight. Thus Pangti and Tsingaki respectively were the informal
heads of leagues against the Aos and Semas. But except for war no village ever acknowledged
the authority of any other village. There are very rarely definite boundaries between
the lands of different villages. In the case of villages situated close to one another
the lands of individuals of either village are inextricably mixed up. The writer once
asked a Lhota why they had no village boundary disputes like Semas and Angamis, to
which he replied, “It would be a shameful thing. Every man knows where his own land
is, so how could there be a quarrel?” The fact that the Lhotas do not suffer from
shortage of land as the Semas and Angamis do also helps to produce this peaceful state
of affairs. In the days when villages were constantly at war each village was ruled
by a chief (<i lang="njh">ekyung</i>) assisted by an informal council of elders. The chieftainship was hereditary in the
family of the man who originally founded the village, but did not at all necessarily
pass from father to son. The most suitable man became chief by force of character.
His main function was that of a leader in war, and his perquisite all the spoils brought
home from raids. In some villages he is said to have had the privilege of the free
labour of the village for his field two or three times a year, but this right has
not been exercised anywhere within living memory and apparently lapsed before the
Hills were taken over, if indeed it ever existed. The Pax Britannica having put an
end to his <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i> and its sole concomitant privilege, the post of <i lang="njh">ekyung</i> has virtually ceased to exist and the word even is rarely heard. Villages are now
managed by an informal council of old men and men of influence, with headmen selected
by Government through whom the village is dealt with. The old men are appropriately
called <i lang="njh">sotsoi</i> (meat-eaters), for they inflict fines of pork in petty cases and eat the fine. <i lang="njh">Sotsoi</i> are divided into <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>two classes called <i lang="njh">tongti</i>, the upper division, and <i lang="njh">chochang</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n97.1src" href="#n97.1">7</a> the lower division. Under them is a council of vague dimensions called <i lang="njh">pangi</i>. Usually the village is run as an undivided whole, but where the “khels” are big
the tendency is for the leading men of each “khel” to manage their affairs independently.
Among the Aos every village is divided up by an ancient and elaborate system into
working companies. The Lhota system is far simpler. Working companies (<i lang="njh">yengaten</i>) are composed of the children of neighbours. Boys and girls work together and help
in the fields of the parents of the various members of the company when there is a
pressure of work. Anyone who is short of labour may hire a company for the day, giving
them their midday meal and a small wage.

<h3 class="main"><i>Property.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Cattle, houses and so on are the property of the individual, but land can be held
either by the village, a “morung,” a clan, or an individual. The land close to a village
is usually waste land and common property, as are the rights of “poisoning” in certain
pools. Every “morung” owns land which is the property of the “morung” as a whole and
not of any individuals in it. It is worked by the boys of the “morung” and the produce
used to buy meat for ceremonies such as the rebuilding of the “morung.” Boys when
they get married and leave the “morung” have to pay a small fine of meat to their
late companions as compensation for the loss of labour. A very large proportion of
the land in the Lhota country is clan land, which is held in common by all members
of that particular clan in the village. A man who leaves a village loses all right
to clan land in the village, a far better system than the Sema system by which a man
claims, though usually in vain, ancestral rights in clan land in a village in which
his great-great-grandfather was the last member of the family to live<span class="corr" id="xd31e5687" title="Not in source">.</span> Every year the members of the clan in a Lhota village meet and <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>apportion out the land which each is to cut that year, the senior men getting the
bigger share. Strangely enough this delicate operation never seems to result in a
quarrel. Strictly speaking a man may not sell land which he has inherited. When direct
heirs fail the land becomes clan land. Were this to go on indefinitely the whole of
the land in a village would in time become clan land, and no one would ever be able
to buy or sell land. To prevent this from time to time, when the amount of common
land becomes unwieldy, the clan meets and divides it up among the members, who thus
each become private owners of a portion of it. The process then begins again. Heirlooms
such as the ancient daos and spears which the Lhota so prizes are held in trust by
the senior member of the clan in the village, provided he has done all the social
“gennas.” To alienate them would bring disaster on the whole clan.

<div id="xd31e5691" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><i>Inheritance.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Property is inherited exclusively by the male heirs. Failing sons or grandsons, brothers,
brother’s sons, first cousins in the male line, and so on, inherit in that order.
The need of the heirs is the primary consideration, a system which in theory is almost
ideal and in practice works excellently. An actual example taken at random will make
the details more easily understood. A died, leaving a widow and three sons B, C and
D, of whom B was the oldest and D the youngest. Of the rice, which was by far the
most valuable part of the property, B got half a granary, C one granary and D three
granaries. What cash there was was divided in the same proportions. D also got the
house. In this case B got least because he was married and independent and had done
all his social “gennas.” C got rather more than B because, though he was married and
independent, he had not finished his “gennas.” D got most of all because he still
had his marriage price to pay and all his “gennas” to do, and had to live with and
support his mother in his father’s old house. The widow inherited nothing in her own
right. Had there been a married daughter she would <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>have got nothing. An unmarried daughter, however, would have lived with her mother
and been supported by D, who would have had his share increased accordingly. Had all
the sons been married either the widow would have been given enough to live on and
the rest shared by the sons, B getting slightly the largest share, or supposing the
widow were too old and feeble to work for herself, she would either have been supported
by all the brothers jointly, or by one of them who would have been given a proportionately
larger share. In short, where one or more brothers have had their marriage prices
paid and have been launched into the world by their father, they get less than a younger
brother who has not had so much spent on him. Had there been no widow the younger
brother would have gone to live with one of his elder brothers, who would have taken
both his share and his younger brother’s share of the property, and paid his younger
brother’s marriage price and launched him into the world as his father would have
done had he lived.<a class="noteRef" id="n99.1src" href="#n99.1">8</a> All land inherited from the father would have been held in common, as described above.
Debts are inherited just as property is, and many a man inherits nothing else. Where
the assets exceed the debts the heirs pay the debts in proportion to their shares
of the assets.

<h3 class="main"><i>Adoption.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though so common among Changs and Semas, adoption is practically unknown among the
Lhotas. One reason is that there are very few people poor enough to be willing to
be adopted, and another that while among the Semas and Changs an adopted man and his
descendants become practically the serfs of their adopter, among the Lhotas the chances
of material gain for the adopter are few. Adoption of a girl seems to be unknown.
There are generally relations of some kind ready to bring her up and get her marriage
price. But boys are very occasionally adopted. Supposing A adopts B, he becomes to
all intents and purposes A’s son, <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>and enters A’s clan, though he can never marry a woman from the clan out of which
he was adopted. A has to find a wife for B and pay his marriage price, yet if B has
a son, the son inherits B’s property, A only inheriting if B has no sons. There is
no ceremony of adoption.

<h3 class="main"><i>Settlement of Disputes.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When a quarrel arises between two villages, messengers are sent to fix a day, and
if both sides so agree the elders of the respective villages meet on the path half-way
between the two villages and settle the matter, exchanging drinks of “madhu” and eating
together. If the responsibility for the quarrel can be fixed on any individual he
is fined, and the fine either divided among the elders of both villages, or given
to the village against which the wrong was done. In the old days villages such as
Okotso and the Ao village of Nankam were in a chronic state of war. It would occasionally
happen that Okotso decided to cut their fields which lay towards Nankam in the same
year as Nankam decided to cut their fields towards Okotso. Obviously cultivation would
be impossible for either side unless a peace of some kind were patched up. The elders
of both villages would feast together on the boundary, and an armistice would be agreed
upon to remain in force till those fields were finally reaped, when the game of war
would go on as before. All preliminary negotiations between villages actually at war
were carried on by ambassadors (<i lang="njh">lantsalanpeng</i>), of which there were two in each village. These had a permanent safe-conduct, and
it was believed that to kill one would bring dire misfortune on the slayer and his
village. The same custom exists among Aos, Changs and Phoms.
</p>
<p>In the case of disputes within the village both sides are summoned before the elders,
and what sounds like the prelude to a free fight takes place. Both the parties, all
the witnesses, and most of the spectators talk at once at the top of their voices.
However, after much shaking of fists and stamping, and solemn affirmations from the
one side that they will <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>never pay such a big fine, and from the other that they will never accept such a small
one, a settlement is arrived at. Each side goes in company with the elders to the
other’s house and drinks “madhu” and promises not to quarrel again. This is regarded
as binding. In the old days if one party would not pay the fine agreed on, the other
party simply went and looted his property and took it. Nowadays cases which cannot
be settled in the village are dealt with in court. Before the Hills were administered,
murder was punished either by turning the murderer out of the village or by taking
the whole of his property and dividing it among the rest of the village other than
the clan of the murdered man, who could not touch any of it. In no case could any
relations of the murdered man ever eat with the murderer. If they did their teeth
would fall out. Nor would the descendants of either side eat together. This breach
can never be healed, and there are still families who cannot eat together.<a class="noteRef" id="n101.1src" href="#n101.1">9</a> For adultery the guilty man had to hand over to the husband’s and woman’s families
all his clothes and personal ornaments and a cow or a large pig. The husband could
not himself take any of this fine, for it was the price of his wife’s immorality.
A clear distinction is drawn between adultery by a man of the husband’s clan and adultery
by a man of another clan. The former offence is often condoned on the guilty party
promising not to repeat it, but a fine is invariably demanded for the latter offence.
A thief had to return the goods in full, or their equivalent, to the owner, and pay
a large pig or a cow to his clan. If he could not pay up he was sold as a slave. No
punishments other than fining or selling into slavery or expulsion from the village
were inflicted on fellow-villagers. But a man of another village who broke a village
<i lang="njh">emung</i> was put in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>stocks and had to be ransomed by his friends. Naga justice was decidedly crude. The
elders accepted “presents” freely from both sides and then favoured the most influential
party. There once lived a famous judge in the Ao village of Ungma who openly amassed
a considerable fortune from “presents.” Yet people came to him from all over the Ao
country, and he died universally respected and is still regarded by the Aos as a model
judge. His reputation chiefly rests on the fact that none of his decisions were ever
questioned! Hardly believing that this could be due to their justice, the writer inquired
the reason, and found that Ungma had sworn that whosoever questioned the decisions
of their beloved judge, his village should be raided. Ungma being the biggest Ao village,
this threat effectively stifled criticism. Troublesome children are sometimes punished
by being whipped across the stomach with nettles, or by having a nettle put in their
ears instead of a flower.

<p class="first">The oath is held in high regard among the Lhotas as it is among the Angamis. A man
who is accused of an offence on suspicion may clear himself by taking an oath. The
commonest form is for a man to bite a tiger or leopard’s tooth and to swear that if
he did such and such a thing may a tiger or leopard kill him. The formula used is
the same in all cases, excepting, of course, that whatever offence the man is accused
of is inserted. For instance a man accused of adultery would swear—

<p>In other words, may he be killed “apotia” by a tiger and the whole village purify
themselves with fire and keep <i lang="njh">emung</i> for him. A few hairs from the swearer’s head, with a little earth, are often bitten
instead of the tooth. In cases where the accusation is of stealing thread or some
such thing, a skein of thread being said by one side to be stolen, and by the other
side to be his own, a little of the thread is put with the hair and the earth. A very
solemn oath which entails a day’s <i lang="njh">emung</i> for the village is that on a leaf of the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>. The heaviest of all is on a <i lang="fr">bonne bouche</i> consisting of a little earth from the place used by the boys of the “morung” as a
latrine, a piece of wood from the house of a man who has died “apotia,” a little earth
from a grave and a few hairs from the swearer’s head. This oath is very rarely taken,
and is thought to involve certain death for the swearer if taken falsely. Land disputes
are occasionally decided on oath, which is invariably sworn on a little soil from
the land in dispute. Whichever side will take the oath gets the land. It is probably
never knowingly taken falsely, as all Lhotas firmly believe that whoever swears this
oath falsely will die before he can reap a harvest from the land he has dishonestly
gained. An ancient oath, which is only remembered by old men, was taken on the huge
boulder known as Deolung. Each side in turn held an egg and swore by Deolung that
their story was true. Whoever went mad first lost! The custom was abandoned, it is
said, “because it was such a terrible oath.” The idea of making both sides swear and
then awaiting results resembles the Ao custom, by which both sides take the same oath,
and the decision goes to the party which suffers no loss of any kind within thirty
days, a system by which the party who is in all probability guilty does, curiously
enough, generally lose. A curious instance came to my notice. The oath was taken in
Ungma on the spot specially associated with the deity of the wind. When the ceremony
began a gale blew up, so suddenly as to attract my attention in my garden three miles
away. Out of a village of six hundred houses thatch was only blown from the roof of
the houses of two men, and those were the two principals on one side in the case.
The blowing of thatch <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>from a man’s roof if he has taken an oath is looked upon by Aos as a sure sign of
false swearing. This story is true and other equally remarkable instances are known
to the writer.

<p class="first">Formal friendships are of great importance. Two men become friends (<i lang="njh">okam</i>) by exchanging gifts, consisting of half a pig, and a spear or dao or some such present,
a piece of iron invariably forming part of the gift. It is usual for the sons of “friends”
to become friends in turn. A man will often possess friends of this kind belonging
to different villages, and frequently to a different tribe. When travelling a man
will stay in his <i>okam’s</i> house in each village he reaches. He in turn will entertain any of his <i>okams</i> who come to his village. A man may not kill his <i lang="njh">okam</i> even if he belongs to a hostile village. Should he happen to kill him in battle with
a spear thrown at a venture he will not take his head. Even if no gifts be exchanged,
two men of the same name regard one another as <i>okams</i>. I have known a man go out of his way to entertain a stranger whom he had never met
before because he bore the same name as his dead son.

<h3 class="main"><i>War and Head-hunting.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By putting a stop to head-hunting the British Government has profoundly changed the
mode of life of all the tribes in the administered area of the Naga <span class="corr" id="xd31e5876" title="Source: Hilla">Hills</span>. In the old days war was the normal and peace the exceptional state of affairs. War
between Lhota villages was rare, and it was absolutely forbidden for one Lhota to
take another Lhota’s head.<a class="noteRef" id="n104.1src" href="#n104.1">10</a> But unless peace had been definitely arranged, any village of another tribe was regarded
as hostile and fair game. This never-ending state of war affected every man, woman
and child in their daily lives. In the morning a band of young men fully armed scouted
round the village and had to <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>report no enemy lying in wait near before any women and children were allowed to leave
the protection of the village fence. All went down to the fields for the day’s work
in a compact body, the men fully armed, leaving behind the small children and old
men and women in the village with a guard. Careful watch, too, had to be kept while
work was going on in the fields, for a favourite method of attack was to rush isolated
family parties while they were weeding or cutting the jungle. Like all Nagas the Lhota
was very keen to take heads, but preferred to do so with the minimum of risk to himself.
A strong, forewarned enemy was rarely attacked. Usually a party of raiders would either
lie in ambush by the village spring, and kill a woman as she came down to take water,
or rush an unsuspecting party working in their fields, or cut off a straggler on some
path. If a whole village turned out to destroy another village a surprise attack at
dawn was generally attempted. Once the defenders had a few casualties or found the
enemy were through their fence they generally turned tail and fled in a wild rout
out at the other end of the village, leaving the wounded and aged to the tender mercies
of the raiders. Similarly, an attack was rarely pressed home against a stout defence,
and once the attackers began to make for home the defenders followed them, cutting
off stragglers. Though heads were not taken, prisoners were captured in affrays between
Lhota villages, and were kept in the “morung” in a sort of stocks consisting of a
heavy log cut to receive a man’s ankle, with a bar of “nahor” wood to keep the foot
from being withdrawn.<a class="noteRef" id="n105.1src" href="#n105.1">11</a> These prisoners had to be well fed and looked after till they were ransomed by their
friends. Akuk once, having captured a rich man from Pangti, had to send a message
to his relations asking that he might be ransomed without further delay, as he drank
so much that the village was beginning to run short of “madhu.” Lhotas took the heads
of men, women and children indiscriminately, except those of infants who had not yet
cut their teeth. These were merely killed, for a head without teeth did not <span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span>count in a warrior’s toll of heads, and so was not worth cutting off. A woman’s head,
however, was regarded as a finer trophy than a man’s, for women were likely to be
carefully guarded. Ordinarily, from each of the slain, the head, toes and fingers
were taken. But if the enemy were pressing close and there was no time to take the
head, an ear only would do as well. A Lhota<a class="noteRef" id="n106.1src" href="#n106.1">12</a> who died recently much desired when he was young to marry a certain Phiro girl. The
minx said she would only accept him if he would take the head of a Rengma girl and
show it to her as a proof of his valour. This put the ardent lover in a quandary,
for, with the British established at Kohima and Wokha, it appeared that he must either
lose his well-beloved or take a head and get into serious trouble. But a brilliant
idea struck him. He caught an unfortunate Rengma girl, cut off her ears without killing
her, and after giving this proof of his valour and devotion, triumphantly married
the Phiro girl.
</p>
<p>When a raid had been decided upon, those who were to take part in it, having slept
apart from their wives the night before, assembled in the morning at the <i>ekyung’s</i> house. There a cock and a pig were killed and a meal eaten. If the cock squawked
when its throat was being cut it was regarded as a bad omen and the expedition was
usually put off. Similarly, anyone who hiccoughed when he was eating the pork stayed
behind, for if he went misfortune would befall him. The credit for every head taken
was shared equally by the men who got in first, second and third spear, called respectively
<i lang="njh">Lingta</i>, <i lang="njh">Ethung</i> and <i lang="njh">Kiwen</i>. It did not matter who actually cut off the head. The head, fingers and toes were
brought home wrapped in a cloth. When the party got within earshot of their own village
they began to chant “<span lang="njh">O Shamashari!</span>” (“O we have killed an enemy!”). The hearing of this in the distance was the signal
for wild excitement and uproar in the village. All streamed out to meet the returning
heroes and see the trophies, replying to each <span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>chant of “<span lang="njh">O Shamashari!</span>” with “<span lang="njh">O Imaiyali!</span>” (“O we are glad<a class="noteRef" id="n107.1src" href="#n107.1">13</a>”). From each head a few hairs were taken and put in a cleft stick which was set up
outside the village gate. The meaning of this is obscure. Lhotas call it <i lang="njh">orrülama</i>, deriving the word from <i lang="njh">orrü</i> (“enemy”) and <i lang="njh">lama</i> (“warm”), and say that it means “warming the earth with an enemy’s head,” so that
the crops will grow and the village increase and multiply. The term may be compared
with <i lang="njh">humtselama</i> (post-warmer), the piece of the scalp which used to be nailed to the post of a new
“morung.”<a class="noteRef" id="n107.2src" href="#n107.2">14</a> The writer has made careful inquiries and can find no trace of any definite belief
that the spirits of dead enemies were in this way made to act as guards of the village
gate, though in some vague way they were believed to help the village. When the heads
were being brought in, anyone who wished to do so and proposed to perform the proper
ceremonies afterwards could touch them with his spear and thereby share in the credit
of the raid. The procession of warriors went round the village, and halting in front
of the house of each man who had taken part in the expedition sang for a few minutes.
Then all the men went to the “morung,” where the old men brought them food and “madhu,”
and sat and listened to their account of their exploits. Every man who had taken a
head or jabbed his spear into one had to pour a little “madhu” on the ground and throw
away a little rice before he could eat or drink anything. This was an offering to
the spirits of the slain enemies. It was believed that if this was not done the “madhu
chunga” and food would be knocked <span class="pageNum" id="pb108">[<a href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>out of his hand by a blow from an invisible spirit. One man assured the writer that
this did actually happen to him once when he forgot to make the necessary small offering.
If there was time that day the heads were hung up at once on the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>. If not they were left in the “morung” till morning. Preparatory to hanging them
up the man who had taken most heads in the village pushed a sharp piece of wood through
each head from one ear to the other, so that a piece of wood about six inches long
stuck out on each side of it. A man’s head was ornamented with the big cotton wool
ear pads which are worn with full dancing dress. A long bamboo with a cane string
ornamented with cane leaves on the end was leant against the branches of <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>, and the head tied by the piece of wood running through it to the string, so that
it hung about six feet from the ground. Anyone could assist at this. The fingers and
toes were enclosed in bamboo basket balls and hung up like heads.<a class="noteRef" id="n108.1src" href="#n108.1">15</a> Everyone who had jabbed the head or any part of the corpse could have a basket ball
hung up as if he had taken a head. That day all who had taken heads or jabbed a corpse
killed a cock. They had to sleep apart from their wives for six nights, and were forbidden
to eat meat from a tiger’s kill. Further, a woman had to remain chaste while her husband
was away on a raid.<a class="noteRef" id="n108.2src" href="#n108.2">16</a> Any breach of this rule, it was believed, would cause her husband to be killed by
the enemy. She was also forbidden to weave lest her husband’s foot should become entangled
in jungle creepers and he should be caught and killed. The blood was not wiped off
daos and spears till the day after the warriors had returned.

</p>
<p>On the sixth day after the heads had been hung up the <i lang="njh">Ramo</i> “genna” took place. On the fifth day everyone who had taken a head or jabbed a corpse
killed a small chicken and hung it up with some boiled rice and “madhu” rice wrapped
in a leaf from the roof of his house in the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> on the left side as you go in. He then cleaned his dao and <span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span>took the omens by pouring the contents of a small “chunga” of “madhu” on the ground
and splitting the “chunga.” Then he wrapped the two halves in a leaf, and opening
the leaf suddenly let them fall to the ground. If one side fell one way up and the
other the other, it meant that the omen was good and it would not be long before he
did the head-taking ceremony again. If both halves fell the same way up no successful
raid would be made in the near future. He then hid the pieces of split “chunga” in
the roof of his house. Next day all the men in the village put on full dress and went
round in procession singing from the <i>Puthi’s</i> house to that of every man who had taken or jabbed a head six days before. Vats of
“madhu” and great wooden dishes of pork were standing ready outside each house, and
everyone ate and drank as much as they could, which was doubtless a good deal. In
the evening the little chickens and the bundles of “madhu” and rice were taken down
and left in the <i>Puthi’s</i> house. He did not eat them himself, but gave them to old people.
</p>
<p>It was most important that every Lhota should either take a head or at least touch
an enemy’s corpse, for unless he had done so he could not put on the ornaments of
a warrior: hornbill tail feathers in his bearskin wig, boar’s tush necklace, red-fringed
gauntlets, red dao-belt, and dark blue lengta with red lines. One hornbill tail feather
could be worn for each head-taking ceremony, but a man rarely wore more than six or
eight at the outside, however many times he had performed the ceremony.
</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the case in the past, at the time when Government first took
over the Lhota country the aspect of a head as a trophy of war and proof of bravery
had become subordinated to a view of it as something which would bring fortune to
the village and enable those who took it or touched it to put on the ornaments of
a warrior, no matter how it had been obtained. The result was that Lhotas were ready
to descend to what was practically human sacrifice. The last head taken by Akuk, some
time in the ’seventies, is a case in point. No heads having been taken for a long
time, they arranged to buy a slave from Nankam. <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>On an agreed date a party of Nankam men set out towards Akuk, taking with them the
unsuspecting slave, who was carrying a load. Half-way between Akuk and Nankam they
were met by some men from the former village. All sat down and drank and talked. The
slave was given a drink of “madhu,” and at a prearranged signal an Akuk man killed
him with a blow of his dao from behind. The head was cut off, and pieces of the body
sent as presents to various villages. Many men touched the head and these blossomed
out as “warriors.” This horrible practice of buying and murdering slaves was, however,
comparatively rare among the Lhotas, who were no worse than many other Nagas in this
respect. Among the Phoms in unadministered territory it is by no means uncommon at
the present day to sell slaves, or in some cases even troublesome freemen of a village.
I have heard of a well-authenticated case in which a Phom sold his own brother.<a class="noteRef" id="n110.1src" href="#n110.1">17</a>
</p>
<p>An interesting relic of war was the practice of mock fights which existed up to about
fifteen years ago. A Lhota village such as Pangti would challenge an Ao or Sema village
to battle on a certain day. Both sides used to turn up at the appointed place in full
dress and feast together. They then separated and fought for say half an hour. Sticks
and stones would fly, and then the two sides would close and attempt to tear off each
other’s ornaments. Daos and spears were barred, but sticks and shields were carried.<a class="noteRef" id="n110.2src" href="#n110.2">18</a> At a signal the fight would cease and the late enemies would settle down to quench
their thirst in amicable groups. Looted ornaments were not returned, however. Men
were pretty badly hurt and occasionally even killed, but I believe <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>no report was ever made to the officials of the district; to have done so would have
been considered unsporting. Men who took part in these battles were allowed to put
on the ornaments of a warrior, provided, of course, they gave the necessary feast
to the old men.

<h3 class="main"><i>Slavery.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In common with their neighbours, Lhotas used to keep slaves (<i lang="njh">’ndri</i>). A thief could be sold by the man whose property he had stolen if he could not return
it, or a debtor could be sold by his creditors. The Aos were great slave-holders and
were always ready to trade in slaves with the Lhotas. There is an old freed slave
woman now in Nankam who was sold by Okotso. The usual price was two or three cows.
Masters had the power of life and death, but slaves seem generally to have been treated
more or less as members of the family, and for the purposes of marriage were regarded
as members of their master’s clan. It was thus forbidden for a man to have immoral
relations with his female slave. He would find a husband for her and take her marriage
price. Her children were then free and regarded as ordinary Lhotas. If, however, a
Lhota girl was arranged as a wife for a slave-man the children of the marriage were
in turn slaves and had no right of inheritance whatever.

<h3 class="main"><i>The Position of Women.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Were it to be suggested to a Lhota that he should go and consult his wife about something
he would reply with a look of utter scorn: “What does a woman know about such things?”
Nevertheless he would very likely not only ask his wife’s advice when he got home,
but take it into the bargain. A Lhota’s wife is by no means a slave or chattel, but
a very real companion. Her duties are nevertheless sharply defined. She must cook
for her husband, look after the children, make the clothes for the family, and carry
up firewood and water. Her husband will help her with a load if need be, and in the
fields they work side by side. You <span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>never see, as you do in Konyak country, the young men idling all day in the shade
in the village while their wives are toiling and digging in the sun. When guests are
present it is the wife who sees that all have enough “madhu,” but as a rule she takes
little part in the conversation. Girls are often married when young, and almost invariably
without being consulted in the matter. The result is that divorces, in which it is
the wife who refuses to stay with her husband, are pretty frequent. Often for the
slightest of causes, or even for no ascertainable reason at all, a woman simply refuses
to live with her husband. She will shed floods of tears over her own supposed grievances
and pay not the slightest attention to his earnest entreaties. It is comparatively
rare for a man to divorce his wife without very good cause, partly because he will
not get his marriage price back if he does. Among the Aos, on the other hand, where
there is no marriage price, a man will divorce his wife in the most heartless manner
when he gets tired of her. One much-respected Ao acquaintance of the writer’s has
up to date divorced nine successive wives because they presented him either with no
children at all or with daughters instead of sons. Very rarely indeed does a case
occur of a Lhota treating his wife cruelly. Were a husband to beat her in the traditional
Whitechapel style she would leave him at once, and her relations would extract a fine.

claim a patrician descent distinct from that of other clans, while the corresponding
Ang clan among the Konyaks still retains its distinct patrician position. I believe
the Changs’ refusal to intermarry with a corresponding Ao clan is probably no older
than the absorption by the Changs of a number of Ao villages at a comparatively recent
date, when they also adopted the practice of exposure of the dead. At the present
time they expose or bury as they feel inclined, but Colonel Woods, who toured in their

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The religion of the Lhota is of that type which is vaguely termed Animism. He believes
in no Supreme Being who rewards the good and punishes the evil. The deities to whom
he sacrifices are some of them neutral, if kept in a good temper with the proper offerings,
and some of them definitely malicious. Yet he is very far indeed from being devil-ridden
and haunted with ghostly fears. He cheerfully carries out what he conceives to be
his <span class="corr" id="xd31e6044" title="Source: religions">religious</span> duties and meets his end like a man when the time comes.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Deities and Spirits.</span> The nearest equivalent to gods is an order of beings called <i lang="njh">Potso</i>,<a class="noteRef" id="n113.1src" href="#n113.1">1</a> who live in a world like ours, of the earthy floor of which our sky is the underside.
The world of the <i>Potsos</i> in turn has a sky which supports yet another <i lang="njh">Potso</i> world, and so on for an unknown number of layers. The only <i>Potsos</i> who affect us are those in the world immediately above our sky. They resemble men
in appearance and have hosts of attendants who are sometimes regarded as their servants
and sometimes as their relations. It is believed that just as the Lhotas have their
<i>Potsos</i>, so the Semas, Aos and other tribes have theirs. The language of <i>Potsos</i> is different from that of men<span class="corr" id="xd31e6075" title="Source: ,">.</span> Some members of the Tsoboi clan are said to claim to know it. <i>Potsos</i> are believed to visit earth from time to time and hold converse with the village
seer (<i lang="njh">ratsen</i>), coming in pairs with a train of attendants <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>and bringing articles symbolical of the fortune the village is going to enjoy during
the year. They send a servant ahead who appears to the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> in a dream and tells him that his masters will come on such and such a day. From
the time when the warning is received till the <i>Potsos</i> come nothing must be killed in the <i>ratsen’s</i> house, and between these dates he must not go outside the village land, or indulge
in sexual intercourse, or eat the flesh of anything killed after he received the warning,
though he may eat meat dried before. For their visit he makes ready “pita madhu” (<i lang="njh">etha soko</i>) and some small fish and rice, and has plantain leaves brought up from the fields
for use as cups. On the night when the <i>Potsos</i> are expected all in the village must go to bed early and shut their doors. The <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> himself sleeps in a room separate from the rest of his family. The <i>Potsos</i> then come and speak to him in a voice which no one else can hear, and show him symbolical
articles from which the future can be foretold. In the morning the marks of the spear
butts of the <i>Potsos</i> and their servants can be seen outside the <i>ratsen’s</i> door. They are easily distinguishable, it is said, from the ordinary marks of spear
butts, for they are much smaller and deeper. This belief seems to show that the <i>Potsos</i> are regarded as coming in material form. The objects brought by the <i>Potsos</i> are generally believed to be taken back by them, but Niroyo village claim that some
of their rice is from seed rice given to a <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> by a <i lang="njh">Potso</i>. A typical instance of this curious belief that these beings from another world sometimes
visit the earth is the supposed visit of <i>Potsos</i> to the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> ’Nchemo of Illimyo in April 1919. ’Nchemo reported that two <i>Potsos</i> came with fourteen attendants and brought with them reeds, meaning sunny weather,
part of a railway carriage (!), meaning elephants would give trouble, two loads of
dark blue thread, meaning that someone would die “apotia,” and a broom, meaning that
wind would damage the crops. The day after a village is visited by <i>Potsos</i> is kept as an <i lang="njh">emung</i> both by the village to which they came and by its neighbours. Formerly if any village
was visited in this way all Lhota villages, however distant, kept one day’s <i lang="njh">emung</i> when <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>they heard the news. Apart from special ceremonies performed to appease or gain the
favour of the <i>Rangsis</i>, <i lang="njh">Sityingo</i> and such-like godlings, it is to the <i>Potsos</i> that prayers are offered in sacrifices. Just as in England huge circular depressions
in the hills are often called Devil’s Punchbowls, so the Lhota tends to assign big
or curious things to the <i>Potsos</i>. For instance, the polished stone celts which are sometimes found in the fields are
regarded as thunderbolts and are called “<i>Potso’s</i> axes” (<i lang="njh">Potsophü</i>). The long flat seed-case, too, of a certain tree is called “<i>Potso’s</i> weaving-sword” (<i lang="njh">Potsotsitam</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="n115.1src" href="#n115.1">2</a>
</p>
<p><i lang="njh">Sityingo</i> is regarded as the lord of wild animals, which he keeps just as men keep pigs and
cattle. Sometimes he can be heard calling the wild pig, but to hear him is very unlucky.
He lives in the jungle and is like a small man, with his head twisted to one side.
By his favour men have luck in hunting. <i lang="njh">Okisityingo</i> (“house-<i lang="njh">sityingo</i>”) is the good genius of the house. He is like a man, but has enormously long fingers
and is spotted all over. He is only seen by men in delirium. So long as he is in a
good temper his influence is good, but he can be harmful if due respect is not shown
him. It is very unlucky if he leaves the house. <i lang="njh">Ngazo</i> is another jungle spirit, practically identical with <i lang="njh">Sityingo</i>. To every village and every man is attached a <i lang="njh">Rangsi</i>, by whose favour the crops are good. No one has ever seen one or knows what one is
like to look at. Just as crops and wild game have their genii, so have the rivers
and streams in <i lang="njh">Tchhüpfu</i> (“water-master”<a class="noteRef" id="n115.2src" href="#n115.2">3</a>), a being like a man with hair of enormous length, who lives at the bottom of deep
pools and uses human skulls as hearth-stones. Small offerings are made to him by some
villages after doing the <i lang="njh">oyantsoa</i> ceremony. One is believed to inhabit a pool called Tchhüpfu izzü in the Doyang below
Morakcho. In the days when men first came out of the earth they were persecuted by
a fiend called <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span><i lang="njh">Khyuham</i>, who ate their children and carried the skulls of his victims about in a basket on
his back. Rankhanda, one of the ancestors of the Lhota tribe, managed to shut him
up in a hole in the earth, the entrance of which he blocked, some say with a stone,
others with a mithan horn. Yet even now a yearly ceremony called <i lang="njh">Epuetha</i> is performed by every family in order to ward off the evil influence of <i lang="njh">Khyuham</i>. Almost every illness is put down to the unhallowed attentions of <i lang="njh">Tsandhramo</i>, invisible fiends who out of sheer malice make men sick by detaining their souls
or by introducing hair or bits of wood or small stones into their bodies, making it
necessary to call in a <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> to extract them. The bright rust-coloured mud which is often seen oozing out of cliffs
is regarded as the excreta of <i lang="njh">Tsandhramo</i>. If these patches are sprinkled with dogs’ teeth the fiends will abandon the place.
In Lakhuti the custom obtains of leaving a spear sticking through the roof of a house
from inside when an inmate is ill. This is supposed to ward off further attacks of
evil spirits. During the influenza outbreak of 1918 the village simply bristled with
spears. The jungle is believed to be haunted by wailing fiends called <i lang="njh">Nangkamo</i>. A famous haunt is below the village of Akuk on the northern slope of the range.
Men are tempted to follow the wailing. If they do they will be affected with such
madness that they will think level ground is steep ground, and steep ground level
ground.<a class="noteRef" id="n116.1src" href="#n116.1">4</a> Ramphan, the great Lhota hero, once speared one of these fiends with a red-hot spear,
and buried it. In the morning he dug it up and found that though when speared it had
the appearance of a man it was now a lizard.<a class="noteRef" id="n116.2src" href="#n116.2">5</a>
</p>
<p>Respect rather than worship is paid to a huge boulder <span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>called Deolung on the north-west side of the path between Lakhuti and Akuk. Everyone
who passes it lays a leaf on a stone in front of it. Lakhuti once sacrificed a chicken
to it, but the experiment was followed by many deaths in the village and was not repeated.
Formerly very solemn oaths were taken on this stone. The story goes that long, long
ago Deolung was attacked by another huge boulder called Tarrlung, who cut his head
off. But Deolung’s friend Matishi, another boulder, was near, to whom Deolung cried
out, “Matishi, Matishi, Tarrlung has cut off my head. Go and waylay him.” So Matishi
took a sharpened bamboo as a spear and waylaid Tarrlung and wounded him so seriously
that he only had strength to stagger away and toppled into the Doyang near Morakcho.
Deolung’s leg is supposed to be somewhere in the plains, but the wound where his head
was cut off, and his head itself, now a rough piece of stone, are still pointed out.
Close to Deolung and a little to the south is a flat slab of stone known as the grave
of Orhendhromo, Deolung’s son, sometimes called Orhendhreni, his daughter. The little
escarpment on which Deolung stands is called “Deolung’s wall” (<i lang="njh">Deolung piku</i>). Matishi is now a big boulder a little distance below the Naga path and to the south-east
of it between Deolung and Akuk. It is regarded both as Deolung’s friend still standing
guard near him, and as his mithan. A lowing sound heard coming from it forebodes some
great disaster. A mark in the sandstone in Akuk village is shown as the mithan’s track,
and a natural hole through a rock there as the place where the mithan was tied up.
Another rock called Napa is believed once to have been endowed with life and to have
walked up from the bed of the Doyang to the place where it now stands on Pyopsü land.<a class="noteRef" id="n117.1src" href="#n117.1">6</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Beliefs concerning the Soul and the Life after Death.</span> The Lhota usually regards himself as having two distinct souls called respectively
<i lang="njh">omon</i> and <i lang="njh">mongyi</i>. The <i lang="njh">omon</i>, which is visible in the form of the man’s shadow and shows its good sense by disappearing
into him when the sky is cloudy and rain threatens, leaves the man some time before
death in cases of serious illness. It may just wander about, in which case it can
often be induced by the proper ceremonies to return, or it may go straight along the
Road of the Dead to the next world, in which case the man dies.
</p>
<p>As an example of this belief the following story, told to the writer by a Rephyim
man, may be related. The man said: “The Road of the Dead in our village runs past
the <i lang="njh">champo</i> in which I used to sleep. One night when I was lying awake I heard someone go stumbling
past towards Wokha Hill, groaning as he went. Then I heard him say, ‘Oh, oh, I cannot
walk,’ and recognized the voice of my brother-in-law, who was very ill. I was frightened
and shouted and woke all in the <i lang="njh">champo</i>. My brother-in-law died next day, for his soul (<i lang="njh">omon</i>) had already gone ahead.” The <i lang="njh">mongyi</i> leaves a man at the moment of death and goes straight to the World of the Dead, where
it joins the <i lang="njh">omon</i> which has already gone on ahead except in cases of very sudden death. Some men do
not distinguish <i lang="njh">omon</i> and <i lang="njh">mongyi</i> (lit. “stupid soul”). The fact is that the Lhota does not analyse the details of
such an unpleasant certainty as death. The Lhotas also believe in a sort of personal
evil destiny called <i lang="njh">nyok</i>, and when looking at the corpse of a man who has died a violent death will hold bunches
of leaves before their faces to prevent his <i lang="njh">nyok</i> affecting them. It appears to correspond to the Angami <i lang="njm">temi</i> or <i lang="njm">rhopfü</i> (cf. Hutton, <i>The Angami Nagas</i>, pp. 98 and 183). A curious belief, apparently at variance with all their beliefs
as to dead men walking to the Land of the Dead, is held by Lhotas in common with Semas
and Aos. It is that if a man kills a flying squirrel during his life, at his death
his soul will fly to the Land of the Dead under the shelter of the wings of the soul
of the squirrel. Col. Shakespear records that the Lushais hold a similar belief with
regard <span class="pageNum" id="pb119">[<a href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>to a bird called <i lang="njh">vahluk</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n119.1src" href="#n119.1">7</a> There are also traces of a belief in the reincarnation of the soul in some lower
form of life. No member of a household in which a death has occurred may take the
life of any creature, whether animal, bird, or insect, till the days of “genna” are
accomplished and the soul has finally left for the Land of the Dead, in case the creature
killed should be the dead man in another form. The Aos have a similar belief.<a class="noteRef" id="n119.2src" href="#n119.2">8</a> The Land of the Dead (<i lang="njh">etchhili</i>) lies under our world and has the bottom of our world for a sky, just as our world
lies under the world of the <i>Potsos</i>. There the dead live exactly as men live here, those who have done good deeds here
being rich and happy, and those who have done evil deeds being poor and miserable.<a class="noteRef" id="n119.3src" href="#n119.3">9</a> As the sun passes under the earth every evening their day is our night. The entrance
to it is a cave (<i lang="njh">etchhiku</i>) on the precipitous eastern face of Wokha Hill. It is inaccessible and no living
man has ever been into the cave, though the story goes that once a man desperate with
grief at the death of his nine children from smallpox managed to scramble down to
it. There on the floor he found spittle and on the side of the cave he found the smallpox
scabs which had been rubbed off against the rock as his children passed in. He could
not enter, for he was still alive, but he went away comforted, for he knew that his
wife and children had really gone to the Land of the Dead, where he would meet them
some day. The cave, which a telescope seems to show does really exist, lies at one
end of a narrow, conspicuous stratum of white rock which looks exactly like a path
and is known as the Road of the Dead (<i lang="njh">etchhililan</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="n119.4src" href="#n119.4">10</a> Below it is another <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>similar stratum, also apparently terminating in a cave, which is believed to be the
road used by the spirits of dead animals, for animals, too, go to the Land of the
Dead. In Yemkha, from whence the roads are clearly seen, it is believed that sometimes
at night lights can be observed moving on the upper road when the dead come out with
torches to meet new-comers and light them on their way. Some say that the spirits
of those who die “apotia,” or at the hands of enemies or by witchcraft, are earthbound
and cannot go to the world of the dead. Others say that they go, but by some different
road. The dead have knowledge of what goes on in this world and jealously watch the
disposal of their property! They can even at times punish the living with sickness.
They appear in dreams, sending their <i lang="njh">omon</i> to the dreamer, for the dead man himself cannot leave the place where he is. As a
sign that he has really been, the <i lang="njh">omon</i> sometimes leaves a present of dead men’s rice (<i lang="njh">etchhitsok</i>). Zambomo of Pangti still uses rice descended from such a present. It is occasionally
necessary to appease the dead. A pig is killed and a share given to a dreamer (<i lang="njh">hahang</i>), who offers it to the dead man in his dreams. This ceremony is called <i lang="njh">etchhienya</i>, and is done by anyone who is heir to the whole of a dead man’s property, and when
there have been many deaths in a family, or if children die one after the other. Though
the dead themselves cannot leave their habitation, the deer they hunt, if hard pressed
by dogs, sometimes come right through the earth and appear on the surface of the ground
in the form of moles. That is why to find a mole above ground forebodes ill luck,
and perhaps even death. Hence the consternation when the writer’s fox-terrier one
day laid a dead mole at a Lhota’s feet.<a class="noteRef" id="n120.1src" href="#n120.1">11</a> Similarly, the male of the Little Pied Flycatcher (<i lang="la">Cyornis melanoleucus</i>) is regarded as the hornbill of the dead.
</p>
<p>Life in the Land of the Dead is certainly not regarded as everlasting, but the Lhota
is very vague as to what the next stage is—the truth being that he does not worry
<span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>himself about the matter. One theory is that men die again and become flies. Another
theory is that every man passes through nine successive lives<a class="noteRef" id="n121.1src" href="#n121.1">12</a> and then ceases to exist.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Religion and Magic.</span> The religion of the Lhota teaches no moral code. The blessings it offers him are
material, not spiritual. Yet many, many Lhotas lead clean, straight, honest lives
and are ever ready to help a lame dog over a stile. It is true that virtue in this
world is vaguely believed to be rewarded with happiness in the next, but this belief
weighs little with a Naga, who rarely turns his thoughts to what is in store for him
after he dies. Whatever it be which causes so many Lhotas to lead virtuous lives it
is not their religion. His religion presents itself to a Lhota as a series of ceremonies
and observances laid down by custom, any one of which it would be dangerous to omit.
Mingled with this idea is the belief in the to the Lhota self-evident maxim that like
produces like. If children squirt water from their mouths rain will fall. To pretend
that you are carrying a heavy load of rice up to the village will ensure good crops!
And so on in every department of life.

An <span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>awkward interregnum is thus avoided, for in the absence of a <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> public ceremonies cannot be performed.<a class="noteRef" id="n122.1src" href="#n122.1">13</a>
</p>
<p>Five days after the death of a <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> the old men of the village meet at the late priest’s house and discuss the question
of his successor. Ordinarily the man in the village who has done <span class="corr" id="xd31e6442" title="Source: must">most</span> social “gennas” is chosen, provided he is otherwise qualified. That is to say, he
must belong to one of the clans who have provided <i>Puthis</i> for that village in the past, and he must never have been wounded by an enemy or
wild animal, or have hurt himself by falling from a tree or rock, or have burnt himself.
In other words, a man who has only just escaped an “apotia” death is not eligible.
Nor must he be deformed or mutilated in any way<span class="corr" id="xd31e6447" title="Not in source">.</span> Once installed he holds office for life. The sole charge on which he can be dismissed
is that of deliberately uttering curses instead of blessings at ceremonies. But even
in this case the village must make good the expenses he has incurred during his time
of office. He is forbidden to go outside the boundaries of the village, lest he should
fall into the hands of enemies and be killed, for in some mysterious way the life
of the village is regarded as bound up with that of its <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>. On his death his successor must perform the ceremony of “making the village” (<i lang="njh">oyantsoa</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="n122.2src" href="#n122.2">14</a> The other occasions on which this ceremony is performed are at the first founding
of a village, when a branch of the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>, or the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> itself, falls, and at intervals of nine or ten years, when the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> thinks it is time it was performed in order that the children, cattle and crops of
the village may increase. It may take place any time during the cold weather before
the rice is sown. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> announces that the ceremony is to take place and goes round with his spear (<i lang="njh">phui</i>) in his hand and his <i lang="njh">Yenga</i> walking behind him, and collects a contribution of rice from every male in the village.
When all have prepared “madhu” the ceremony begins with the killing <span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>of a dog outside the <i>Puthi’s</i> house. The formalities are the same as at the building of a new “morung,” except
that the man who decapitates the dog at once cuts off its ears and places them on
the roof of the <i>Puthi’s</i> house, over the door. Next morning the unmarried men and boys of the village, having
remained chaste for three days, go into the jungle and cut a log about six feet long
and a foot and a half in diameter. This is trimmed flat on one side. One end is left
square and the other end is sloped off from about two feet from the top. This they
drag up to the village and set up just outside the village fence at the place (<i lang="njh">opyachama</i>) which the tradition of the village ordains, with the flat side facing the village.
No woman must see it dragged in, and for the three preceding days the village must
keep strict <i lang="njh">emung</i>, even sewing and weaving being forbidden. In front of the post, which is known as
<i lang="njh">opya</i>, all the males of the village in full dress assemble and feast. The women may look
on from a distance, but may not mix with the men. Then the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> holds in his right hand a perfectly clean dao lent by an unmarried man who has observed
strict chastity during the preceding three days, and in his left hand a cock. After
the traditional prayer (<i lang="njh">dranda</i>) for the prosperity of the village he cuts the cock’s throat with the dao and proceeds
to take the omens from its entrails. A sharp stick is then run into the base of the
bird’s skull at the back and it is set up at the foot of the <i lang="njh">opya</i>. Then at a signal from the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> all, shouting as if in battle, throw mock bamboo spears at the <i lang="njh">opya</i>. All then repair to the “morung” chanting <i lang="njh">shamashari</i>, the chant of warriors who are bringing home heads, and <i lang="njh">hoiki enyam</i>, a long-drawn high note followed by two short low notes. From the “morung” they go
to the <i>Puthi’s</i> house, and after chanting there disperse. All men must refrain from sexual intercourse
for this night. In some villages (<i>e.g.</i> Rephyim) a straw collar is fastened round the <i lang="njh">opya</i> at the point where the flat side is sloped off towards the top. Only warriors and
men of importance, who fasten a little tuft of red goat’s hair to the butt of their
bamboo spears, may spear the <i lang="njh">opya</i> above this collar.<a class="noteRef" id="n123.1src" href="#n123.1">15</a> The <i lang="njh">opya</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span>may be compared with the figure put up by the Quoireng and Kabui Nagas, who make a
similar distinction between hits on the head and on the body.<a class="noteRef" id="n124.1src" href="#n124.1">16</a> Whether the <i lang="njh">opya</i> represents a human sacrifice or the killing of an old <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> whose failing powers would involve disaster to the village is perhaps an open question.
But it is significant that the <i lang="njh">opya</i> is believed occasionally to groan after being speared. The next day the <i lang="njh">oha</i> (lucky stones) under the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> are counted. The whole village having assembled at the tree, while the women look
on from a respectful distance, the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> lifts up the <i lang="njh">oha</i> one by one, and on the place where they were lays the two ears of the dog which were
put on his roof. He then replaces the stones one by one, counting them as he does
so, and announces the total to the village. If the stones have increased since the
last counting it is a good omen. If they have decreased it is an evil omen. All then
stand round the tree and flourish their spears and chant the <i lang="njh">shamashari</i>. A light fence is next built round the tree, with a door which is, however, carefully
kept shut. After much walking round the tree and chanting all go to their own houses.
Some days later—in some villages after five days, in others after ten—the young men
and the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> again repair to the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> to open the door in the fence. Before this can be done the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> squats in front of the gate in the fence holding a good dao with the unsharpened
face<a class="noteRef" id="n124.2src" href="#n124.2">17</a> of the blade upwards in his right hand and an egg in his left. Addressing the <i>Potsos</i>, he says, “I have remained chaste. I have eaten no unclean thing. Now help me and
be favourable.” He then rolls the egg very slowly down the blade of the dao. It is
an evil omen if it falls either over the edge or over the back. He sets the egg on
its end on the ground and puts thirty tiny pieces of dog’s flesh on each side of it.
The gate is then opened and after the usual chanting the ceremony is at an end. A
<span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span>village which has done the <i lang="njh">oyantsoa</i> “genna” must not allow any uncooked rice to leave the village till after the next
<i lang="njh">Tuku</i> “genna.”

</p>
<p>After the <i lang="njh">oyantsoa</i> “genna” and before the fields are cut for the next year’s cultivation, some villages
perform a ceremony called <i lang="njh">Pyotsoja</i> in honour of <i lang="njh"><span class="corr" id="xd31e6630" title="Source: Tcchüpfu">Tchhüpfu</span></i>, the godling of rivers. On the appointed day the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> sets out from the village early in the morning, accompanied by all the grown-up men
of the community. A bird-hunt is organized, and when one has been caught alive all
go down to the Doyang. On the bank the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> kills a hen and lays out ten scraps of its flesh on his up-stream hand for <i lang="njh"><span class="corr" id="xd31e6641" title="Source: Tcchüpfu">Tchhüpfu</span></i> and nine scraps on his down-stream hand. A miniature raft of bamboos is made, on
which are put an egg, a little cotton wool and the live bird tied by the leg. The
raft is then allowed to float down-stream. If it upsets it is a bad omen and it is
believed that someone will be drowned during the term of office of the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>. A little poison is then pounded into the stream and the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> gets into the water and flounders about like a stupefied fish. His <i lang="njh">Yenga</i> plunges in and seizes him and calls out, “I have caught such and such a fish! No,
it is such and such a fish! No it is not; it is such and such a fish,” and so on,
calling out the names of different kinds of fish. Of the fish killed the first is
offered to <i lang="njh"><span class="corr" id="xd31e6654" title="Source: Tcchüpfu">Tchhüpfu</span></i> as the chicken was, and the rest are divided up among those present.
</p>
<p><i lang="njh">Oyantsoa</i> is followed by the ceremony of “calling the <i lang="njh">Rangsi</i>” (<i lang="njh">Rangsitsa</i>), which takes place when the rice has begun to sprout, before the season of thunderstorms
sets in, for the thunder would prevent the <i>Rangsis</i> from hearing the voices of those calling them. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> kills a big pig in his house, and taking a bamboo mat, some of the boar’s meat, an
egg, a fowl and a little rice goes with the whole village a short way down the path
up which the first Lhota settlers came to found the village. The chicken is killed
and the omens taken and the egg and meat laid out on the ground exactly as in the
<i lang="njh">Amungkam</i> and <i lang="njh">Rangsikam</i> ceremonies. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> then spreads the mat in the ground and sprinkles a little unhusked rice over it.
Then beginning with Honohoyanto, <span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span>Kisiyo and Dilungcham he calls out the name of every Lhota village, both extinct and
existing, and summons its <i lang="njh">Rangsi</i> to come and give rice to his village. Meanwhile the whole village, every man, woman
and child having brought a rice basket, sets the baskets on the ground and beckons
to the <i>Rangsis</i> who are supposed to be trooping up in obedience to the summons. The baskets are held
as if someone were pouring rice into them and then covered quickly with a cloth. All
go home in single file with much grunting, as if they were carrying heavy loads, the
<i lang="njh">Puthi</i> bringing up the rear. Arrived at the village everyone carefully pours the imaginary
rice out of his basket into his rice house. Among the Northern Lhotas the young men
of the village on the day before this “genna” make a point of trying to steal water
from some other village’s supply to put into their own. If they are caught they must
submit to a good hiding.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Yenga</i>.</span> The assistant of the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>, who accompanies him at all ceremonies and carries his load, is called <i lang="njh">Yenga</i>. He must be an old man who has done no social “gennas” and is appointed for life.
In villages where there are two <i>Puthis</i> each has his <i lang="njh">Yenga</i>. He receives a share of the meat at all “gennas” and one small basket of rice from
every house in the village once a year. In cases where the only or both <i>Puthis</i> are ill the <i lang="njh">Yenga</i> may perform ceremonies as if he were <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Minor Religious Officials.</span> The post next in importance to that of <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> is that of <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i> (“pig-killer”), of which there are usually two in a village, though in big villages
such as Tsingaki there are two for each clan. A <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i> may carry a <i lang="njh">phui</i> spear as the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> does. His duty is to kill animals at private sacrifices. Below the <i>Wokchungs</i> are two <i lang="njh">’Nchuko</i> (“hearth-bringers”), who bring the small stones with which miniature hearths are
made at social “gennas.” Next below are two <i lang="njh">Sorhung</i> (“meat-dividers”), who divide up the meat at all sacrifices and settle all disputes
as to the respective shares. No one may act as <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i>, <i lang="njh">’Nchuko</i>, or <i lang="njh">Sorhung</i> unless he has performed all social “gennas” and dragged a stone. There is nothing
to prevent the offices of <i lang="njh">Puthi</i>, <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i>, <i lang="njh">’Nchuko</i> and <i lang="njh">Sorhung</i> being combined in the same person.

<h3 class="main"><i>Public Ceremonies.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides the ceremonies intimately connected with agriculture which have already been
described, there are certain other public ceremonies of a more general character.
The year officially opens with the <i lang="njh">Pikuchak</i> “genna,” but before that is performed the omens for the whole village are taken at
a ceremony called <i lang="njh">Sirosi</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Sirosi</i> ceremony.</span> The procedure at Pangti, to take an instance, is as follows. The men of the village
all assemble in front of the senior <i>Puthi’s</i> house, the boys of each <i lang="njh">champo</i> bringing meat in new baskets and “chungas” of “madhu.” The two <i>Puthis</i> in full dress lead the way a short distance down the path to Okotso, each holding
a “chunga” of “madhu” in his right hand. A short distance beyond the village fence
they sit down and together say the <i lang="njh">dranda</i>, praying that their enemies may make peace and come and eat with them, that tigers
may not kill their cattle nor hawks their chickens, and that the village may flourish
and grow big. This prayer is offered facing away from the village, and at the end
of it each <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> pours a little “madhu” on the ground. Some meat and “madhu” are distributed, and
all go up to the village again and a short way down the path to Are, where the same
ritual takes place. On the Are path, just below the place where the prayers are said,
is a small clump of big trees growing close together. Between their stems is the traditional
spot at which omens are taken at <i lang="njh">Sirosi</i>. The prayer ended all the boys rush down the hill shouting, and hurl bamboo spears
at the trees. Then all go down and scrape the earth clean at the proper spot. Here
each <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> sets up an egg on end, asking that the good or evil fortune of the coming year may
be revealed, and takes the omens by cutting chips from a green twig and watching how
they fall. The future is really believed to be revealed by the kinds of insects which
are caught near the egg, and all sit and watch while the boys hunt industriously in
the grass. Locusts mean that sambhur hunting will be good (for they have big legs).
Stick insects are interpreted as showing that many men will take new wives, <span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span>but will have no children by them. Small white insects show that the crops will be
poor, and so on. When a few insects have been caught, and their significance has been
expounded by the <i>Puthis</i> and old men, all go home.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Pikuchak</i> ceremony.</span> The <i lang="njh">Pikuchak</i> “genna” marks the beginning of the agricultural year. The Northern Lhotas do it before
clearing the jungle on their fields, and the Southern Lhotas after. In any case it
must be done before the rice is sown. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> announces the day on which the ceremony is to be, and every <i lang="njh">champo</i> buys meat, and each <i lang="njh">champo</i> in turn the cock which is to be sacrificed. On the night before the “genna” sexual
intercourse is forbidden. On the day all the men of the village assemble at the place
where the <i lang="njh">opya</i> is set up. In front of the <i lang="njh">opya</i> the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> sets up a miniature <i lang="njh">opya</i>, and in front of that again puts an egg on the ground with a leaf on each side. <span class="corr" id="xd31e6844" title="Source: Ou">On</span> the leaf to his right he puts ten little bits of pork and ten little bits of ginger,
and on that to his left nine little bits of each. He then recites the <i lang="njh">dranda</i>, holding the cock in his left hand, and a dao in his right. This dao belongs to the
youth who caught the cock the night before, the <i lang="njh">champo</i> whose turn it is to provide the cock having selected some days before a youth whose
duty it is to go to the house of the seller of the cock and catch it on the evening
before it is sacrificed. This youth must abstain from all intercourse with the opposite
sex from the time he is chosen to the end of the ceremony. The <i lang="njh">dranda</i> being ended the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> cuts the cock’s throat, takes the omens from its entrails and ties it on to the miniature
<i lang="njh">opya</i>. The old men sit down and eat some of the meat which the boys from the <i lang="njh">champos</i> have bought and all go back to the village with much chanting. Parties of boys walk
singing six times round each <i lang="njh">champo</i>. The rest of the day is given up to feasting. Next day is kept as an <i lang="njh">emung</i> and no one goes to the fields, but a party, consisting of boys and one or two old
men, go out on a mock head-taking raid. First they go to the <i lang="njh">opya</i>, where one of the old men sets up a miniature <i lang="njh">opya</i> and makes the same offerings of an egg, meat and ginger as were made the day before.
Then the party goes into the jungle and throws spears at trees <span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>and shouts as if engaged with the enemy. Then all return to their <i>champos</i>, in some villages openly, in other villages by roundabout paths and in dead silence.
Finally after sitting in the <i lang="njh">champo</i> for a little, as they would after a raid, all go to their houses. It is believed
that this mock raid ensures good crops and hunting and a high birth-rate for the village.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Rangendri</i> ceremony.</span> After <i lang="njh">Pikuchak</i>, but before the crops are sown, a “genna” called <i lang="njh">Rangendri</i> is performed, at which imitation heads are hung on the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>. The <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> collects rice and with it buys a pig which he kills outside his house. Going outside
the village fence he lays thirty tiny pieces of the flesh on each of two leaves and
prays that inasmuch as the warriors of the village are following the customs of their
forefathers, good fortune may come to all. Then a few men of standing make globular
bamboo baskets, such as are used for fingers, ears, bits of scalp and other trophies
of Naga warfare, and hang them up on the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>. These are spoken of as “heads,” and each man who hangs one up sacrifices a fowl
and feasts the village as if he had really taken and hung up an enemy’s head. The
performance of this “genna” does not permit a man to wear any of the ornaments of
a warrior, but entitles him to have one representation of a head put on his grave
for each time he does it.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Tuku</i> ceremony.</span> The agricultural year closes with the <i lang="njh">Tuku</i> ceremony. Five days after he has given notice of the “genna” the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> goes round with his <i lang="njh">Yenga</i> and collects unhusked rice from every house. Men married in the course of the year
have to make an extra large contribution, and receive in return a special blessing
from the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> when he visits them on his round. Two days later he collects husked rice in the same
manner. With some of the unhusked rice he makes “pita madhu,” and with part of the
rest buys a pig. The eighth day from that on which the unhusked rice was collected
is known as <i lang="njh">kichan</i>. On it the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> spears the pig at the <i lang="njh">opya</i>, or among the Northern Lhotas just outside the village fence. The stomach is eaten
there by the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> and the old men, and the rest of the meat divided up and distributed, those who gave
most rice naturally getting most <span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span>pork. The pig must not be singed to get the hair off or the crops will fail. From
the day when the unhusked rice is collected to <i lang="njh">kichan</i> nothing must be killed or sold in the village, and no meat from a tiger’s kill must
be brought in. The day after <i lang="njh">kichan</i> is called <i lang="njh">remphi</i> or <i lang="njh">tuku inshuk</i>. On it animals and fowls may be killed and the day is given up to feasting, the working
companies especially who have worked together during the year holding little feasts
to which they have all subscribed, or visiting the houses of the different members.
Next day <i lang="njh">emung</i> is observed. On it the ornaments and all erections on graves are thrown away.<a class="noteRef" id="n130.1src" href="#n130.1">18</a> No rice may be cut after this “genna.” <i lang="njh">Tuku emung</i> being intimately connected with the dead, it is chosen as a time for taking omens
which will show who is to die in the course of the year. The night before the boys
of the <i lang="njh">champo</i> sprinkle ashes carefully round the entrance to their sleeping-rooms. These are examined
for tracks very early in the morning before anyone has gone out. Should a track be
found fitting the foot of any of the boys it is believed that that boy’s <i lang="njh">omon</i> has gone to the Land of the Dead, and that he will assuredly follow it before the
next <i lang="njh">Tuku emung</i> comes round.

<h3 class="main"><i>Ceremonies for Rain.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The rainfall in the Naga Hills is usually adequate. Nevertheless various rain-compelling
ceremonies are practised, most of them of a very simple nature. The usual one resembles
that in vogue among the Semas. A gibbon’s head and a small dead <i lang="njh">tserü</i> fish, with its mouth kept open by a piece of stick, are pegged down to the bottom
of the nearest stream. When enough rain has fallen the gibbon’s head is taken out,
the fish being left in the water to rot. Another common method is to dig a little
tunnel and pour in water at <span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>one end and let it run out at the other. In Akuk a stick is rattled about to imitate
the sound of rain in the hole to which Deolung tied up his mithan, water being poured
in meanwhile. Sometimes children go about with “chungas” of water and spray it from
their mouths over passers-by and each other. Niroyo, Wokha and their neighbours fell
a tree across the path leading from the village to the Road of the Dead. All then
go home holding leaves over their heads and saying that it is raining. To increase
the flow of the village spring in times of drought someone goes down at night to the
Doyang, and leaving an offering of four little bundles of meat and an egg on the bank,
brings up a little water in a “chunga” and pours it into the village supply.
</p>

</div>
<div id="xd31e6984" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><i>Individual Ceremonies.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Potsokam</i> ceremony.</span> Many of the ceremonies performed by individuals, such as those connected with agriculture,
have been described under their respective headings. Three main classes may, however,
be considered here, namely, those performed regularly for the general welfare of the
household, those which are connected with illness, and those social “gennas” on which
the status of the individual Lhota depends.
</p>
<p>A “genna” called <i lang="njh">Potsokam</i> (“present to the <i>Potsos</i>”) is performed every year, or oftener in case of sickness. The regular time for it
is just before the new “jhums” are cut. The master of the house kills a small pig
of either sex inside the house. He then mixes “madhu” and a few blades of rice which
have sprung up in his granary among the damp grain, and ties them in a leaf which
he affixes to one of the centre-posts of the house. Then of the pig which has been
killed he cooks sixty small pieces, which he wraps up in a <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaf and holds up near the centre-post, with the prayer that there may be no sickness
or misfortune in the house. The bundle is then put in the basket or “chunga” in which
the day’s supply of rice is kept. Then two leaves containing six pieces of meat each
and two leaves containing four pieces of meat each are prepared for the dreamer (<i lang="njh">hahang</i>) whom the performer of the rite patronizes. The dreamer must come <span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>and fetch them himself in the evening. When he goes out the door is shut hurriedly
after him lest the good genius of the house (<i lang="njh">okisityingo</i>) should escape. None of the flesh of the pig may be eaten that night, during which
the husband must sleep apart from his wife. In the morning the dreamer comes to report
what visions he has had and counts the pieces of meat in the rice bin. If the full
number is found and the leaf is wet with congealed moisture all is well. A reduction
in the number of pieces foretells evil. It is regarded as particularly fortunate if
a little rice is found mixed with the meat. This is regarded as a gift from the dead
and ensures good crops. Anyone may see the sacrifice of the pig, but were anyone to
steal and eat a piece of meat his mouth would become deformed.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The <i lang="njh">Epuetha</i> ceremony.</span> The story goes that the evil spirit <i lang="njh">Khyuham</i>, when shut up in a hole in the earth by Rankhanda, exacted a promise that he should
be appeased by a yearly sacrifice. In fulfilment of this the Lhota householder, year
by year just before the <i lang="njh">Thruven</i> “genna,” kills a small boar in his house and puts into a carrying basket twenty-three
little pieces of the meat, a handful of rice husks, an egg, a handful of boiled rice
and a “chunga” of “pita madhu.” The ceremony is performed in the <i lang="njh">lhurhui</i> room, by an old man who has done no “gennas,” called in for the purpose. Holding
a “chunga” of “saka madhu” in his hand he prays for the welfare of the household,
and after spilling a little on the ground drinks. He then pounds up some ginger, the
usual magical disinfectant, in a leaf and pours a little “pita madhu” over it. While
he is doing this members of the family scrape all their daos and spears one against
the other. Then the old man, addressing <i lang="njh">Khyuham</i>, says, “We have given you all the things in this house. Do not harm anyone,” and
as he speaks sprinkles a little of the ginger and “pita madhu” about the room, laying
what is left in a leaf at the foot of the main post of the house, that is to say the
post between the <i lang="njh">lhurhui</i> and the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>. This done he takes up a brand from the hearth and the carrying basket containing
the twenty-three pieces of pork and other things, and goes out of the house, calling
on all evil spirits to follow <span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span>him. As he goes the household throw after him ashes and burning brands, another powerful
type of magical disinfectant, and shutting the door quickly keep it closed for a few
minutes. The old man goes into the jungle just outside the village fence and there
lights a small fire and spills a little “pita madhu” on the ground. Setting the egg
up on end he puts on each side of it a little heap of rice husks on a leaf, six little
sticks, six little pieces of ginger, and six scraps of meat. The “chunga” which held
the “pita madhu” is by this time empty. This he splits with his dao and watches how
the two halves fall. If both fall inside up or outside up the omen is good, but if
one falls one way and one the other it is bad. The two halves are then laid on either
side of the egg, and the old man having eaten the rest of the rice and meat goes straight
to his house. He must not enter the house where the ceremony was performed again that
evening. In the morning he goes back to return the carrying basket and receives a
small handful of rice as his fee.

<h3 class="main"><i>Ceremonies for Illness.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Lhota when sick usually attributes his illness to the malice of an evil spirit (<i lang="njh">tsandhramo</i>), who has either introduced some foreign matter, such as hair or a little stone,
into his body or has caused his soul (<i lang="njh">omon</i>) to desert him at a certain place. In any case a <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> has to be called in, who can see and “extract” any foreign body which may be the
cause of the trouble, or can say at what spot his soul left him and is likely to be
lurking. To enable the man to regain his soul a soul-caller (<i lang="njh">montsai</i>) is required, who must be an old man who has done no social “gennas.” If it is on
his own land that the man’s soul has left him a dog must be sacrificed. The <i lang="njh">montsai</i> and the sick man, if he be well enough, go down to the spot indicated by the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i>. If the sick man be too ill, as is often the case, a near relation goes, who may
be either a man or a woman among the Southern Lhotas, but must be a man among the
Northern Lhotas. On arrival at the spot the <i lang="njh">montsai</i> lights a fire, <span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>and killing the dog by knocking it on the head, singes it and cuts it up. On his right
the <i lang="njh">montsai</i> puts ten pieces of meat and ten pieces of ginger on two leaves, and nine pieces of
meat and nine pieces of ginger on two leaves on his left. The paws, ears and nose
are cooked in a pot which has been specially brought for the purpose, and left there
in the pot. The rest of the meat is the <i>montsai’s</i> perquisite. He goes back to the village, repeatedly calling the sick man’s soul by
the man’s name to follow him.
</p>
<p>When the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> says that it was at some place in the jungle or on the village path that the patient’s
soul left him and is being kept away by a <i lang="njh">tsandhramo</i>, an interesting ceremony with a scapegoat chicken is performed. The <i lang="njh">montsai</i> and a relation of the patient go to the spot where the soul is said to be, taking
with them a carrying basket containing two “chungas” of “madhu,” sixty pieces of plantain
stem blackened with soot, twelve pieces of burnt wood, sixty little bits of pork,
a small chicken, a cowrie, some ginger, some taro, some heads of a species of wild
mint called <i lang="njh">rarakham</i>, which is believed to be an infallible antidote against evil spirits, and a burning
brand. Throughout the ceremony the patient’s relation is a mere spectator. Assuming
that the “genna” is being performed on a path, as is usually the case, for the patient
was probably travelling along a path when the <i lang="njh">tsandhramo</i> took possession of his soul, the <i lang="njh">montsai</i> places equal portions of the ginger, <i lang="njh">rarakham</i>, meat, plantain stalk, burnt wood and taro on either side of the path. This he does
sitting facing away from the village to which the patient belongs. He pours the “madhu”
from the smaller of the two “chungas” onto the ground, and lays the empty “chunga”
down with its base towards the village. The carrying basket is split in half, and
half put on either side of the path. The <i lang="njh">montsai</i> now drinks the contents of the large “chunga,” and splitting it with his dao lays
his dao on the ground with the blade away from him. Then six times if the patient
is a man, or five times if she is a woman, he drops the two halves of the split “<span class="corr" id="xd31e7102" title="Source: chnuga">chunga</span>” together onto his dao, asking each time, “Will he live or die?” If both halves come
to <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>rest on the same side of the dao the illness will be a long one. If one falls on one
side and one on the other the patient will either die or get well soon. Next having
tied the chicken’s wings together over its back and fastened a cowrie onto its leg,
he tosses it up and catches it six times for a man and five times for a woman, and
undoing its wings lets it go into the jungle. He then takes his spear and jabs the
butt into the ground a number of times, in order that the <i lang="njh">tsandhramo</i> may think that a large number of men have come to call back the sick man’s soul and
so be more ready to let it go. Finally, he calls out the name of the patient eight
times, and says, “O so and so. We have let a chicken go for you. Come back, come back.”
On his way back to the village he must keep on calling the sick man by name, and on
arrival at the patient’s house he says, “I have called so and so. Has he come?” and
one of the inmates will answer, “He has come.” The <i>montsai’s</i> fee for this ceremony is a small basket of rice. This account is of the ceremony
as performed by the Northern Lhotas. The only difference the Southern Lhotas make
is that instead of sixty pieces of pork they take down either a crab or a jungle rat
or squirrel, which they laboriously divide up into sixty tiny pieces. The reason for
this is that they regard it as essential that a whole animal, however small, should
be offered. This employment of a scapegoat chicken is common to Lhotas, Aos, Semas,
Changs and probably most Naga tribes.
</p>
<p>If a man be only slightly indisposed on his return from a journey the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> will tell him that a <i lang="njh">tsandhramo</i> is detaining his soul at such and such a place on the path along which he came—always
a spot conveniently near the village—and that an offering of eggs is all that is required.
The sick man will then either go with a <i lang="njh">montsai</i> or alone to the place. There the <i lang="njh">montsai</i>, or the patient if he goes alone, puts on either side of the path a big leaf and
an egg, and on the leaf taro, ginger, boiled rice, burnt wood and cotton, chilies,
or whatever he may have been carrying when his soul was enticed away. He then goes
home, calling his soul in the ordinary way. The cheapness of this <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>method of regaining his soul appeals to the Lhota, who performs the ceremony on the
least provocation. In cases of long illness more persuasion is required to induce
the soul to return. A meal is prepared in the house, great care being taken that no
stranger touches it, and put wrapped up in leaves in a carrying basket with a new
cloth and the patient’s ornaments. This is taken to the <i>montsai’s</i> house, who that night meets the patient’s soul in his dreams and tries to persuade
it to return by pointing out that food and new clothes and ornaments are all ready
for it if only it will come back. If it cannot be persuaded to return by these inducements
the patient is doomed.
</p>
<p>A person suffering from intermittent fever or some similar slight ailment gets rid
of it as follows. He gets up from his seat in his house and puts any bits of rubbish,
such as sticks or leaves, into an old carrying-basket. Taking up this load he says
aloud, “I am going out to get some things.” Having reached the outskirts of the village
he hangs his load on a bush and says, “Watch this; I am coming back very soon.” He
then leaves the load with the illness watching it, as he thinks, and returns to his
house by another path. Semas practise a similar custom for ophthalmia.

<div id="xd31e7133" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><i>The Social “Gennas.”</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There remain to be described the social “gennas,” which play such an enormously important
part in Lhota life. Beginning from the first small “genna” they increase in costliness
and importance till the ceremony at which two stones are dragged is reached. Almost
every one of them entitles the doer to wear a distinctive cloth. The wealth and consequently
the importance of a man is gauged by the number of these social “gennas” he has done,
for the Lhota, like all Nagas and members of not a few other races, is a great respecter
of wealth. It is therefore the ambition of every man to perform the full series if
he possibly can. At the first stone-dragging ceremony one stone is dragged, and at
the second, third and so on two stones are dragged. There is a limit to the number
of times the stone-dragging <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>ceremony may be done, which varies in different villages, but is so rarely reached
that it practically exists only in theory. The only man the writer has ever come across
who has reached the limit is Wonchă̤̱mo of Pangti, who has dragged twenty-five stones.
The only course open to him now if he wishes to do any more social “gennas” is to
“become a boy again” and sleep in the <i lang="njh">champo</i> and begin the whole series again from <i lang="njh">Wozütana</i>, the first small “genna.” This he does not propose to do. Though cases have been
known in the past of men reaching the limit, there is no tradition of anyone who began
the series again.<a class="noteRef" id="n137.1src" href="#n137.1">19</a> The “gennas” are public feasts which the whole village attends, but the man who proposes
to do one must never announce his intention beforehand except in a whisper to his
nearest friend and the necessary religious officials. This custom is strictly adhered
to. Even a Lhota in Government employment who wishes to go to his village to perform
a social “genna” will never say when he applies for leave what he wants it for. Were
a man to announce that he was going to do one of these ceremonies and then not be
able to do so it would, it is believed, entail a serious illness or some other misfortune.
</p>
<p>For the ceremonies where a mithan is sacrificed a black hybrid or black bull may be
substituted, but the substitute is invariably spoken of as a mithan. The following
defects<a class="noteRef" id="n137.2src" href="#n137.2">20</a> make an animal unfit for sacrifice—a hole in the horn, one horn deformed or shorter
than the other, one horn missing, teeth missing or broken, white marks on the body,
white on the tail or forehead (though an animal with white both on the tail and forehead
may be sacrificed), deformed hoof and white on the leg unless all four legs are white.
It is <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>believed that were a man to sacrifice an animal with one of these defects he would
almost certainly die. Under no circumstances may the flesh of an animal which has
been sacrificed be eaten either by the sacrificer or any of his household. It is believed
that anyone who broke this rule would go mad. There is a man in Pangti who is supposed
to have become insane for this reason. Whatever may be the real cause he is certainly
afflicted with madness, and of a kind particularly obnoxious to the writer, for it
takes the form of making interminable complaints about imaginary wrongs. Again in
Humtso the writer came across a case in which a woman tried to poison her husband
by scraping shavings off the horns of a mithan he had sacrificed and mixing them with
his “madhu.”
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The First Social “Genna.”</span> Like all social “gennas” the first one, <i lang="njh">Wozütana</i>, is usually performed in the cold weather when there is a certain amount of leisure
from work in the fields. It is a very simple affair which is often performed by a
man before marriage. He invites all the men of his clan in the village who have done
<i lang="njh">Wozütana</i>, and kills a bull of any colour behind the house. This is divided up among the guests
and much “madhu” handed round. Little presents of meat, too, would ordinarily be sent
to fellow-clansmen in neighbouring villages. Next day the man who has done the “genna”
must not give a drink of “madhu” to a man of another village. The head of the bull
sacrificed on this occasion is not kept. The man who performs this “genna” is entitled
to wear the cloth called <i lang="njh">phangdrap</i>.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Second Social “Genna.”</span> The second social “genna,” <i lang="njh">Shishang</i>, or, as the Southern Lhotas call it, <i lang="njh">Wozüyua</i>, is a much more elaborate business and is usually not performed till after marriage.
A big pig and a bull of any colour are bought and “madhu” is prepared and kept in
the middle room. From the time the “madhu” is made till the end of the “genna” the
man doing the “genna” must not eat meat from the kill of a tiger or leopard or other
animal. When all is ready he calls a <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i> to his house, gives him a “chunga” of “rohi madhu” and formally announces to him
that he proposes <span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>to do the <i lang="njh">Shishang</i> “genna.” The <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i> thereupon offers a prayer for the performer’s welfare, and after pouring a little
of the “madhu” on to the floor drinks the rest and departs. Then the husbands of women
of the sacrificer’s clan go into the jungle and fields and bring <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves and plantain leaves for cups for the next day’s ceremony. Next day the same
men kill the pig and the bull in front of the performer’s house, the bull by cutting
the skin over the heart and then pushing a sharpened stick home, and the pig with
a blow of a stick on the back of the head. In “the good old days” before the Hills
were administered the bull was beaten to death as slowly as possible—“great fun,”
as old men often say with a sigh. The two <i>Wokchungs</i> and two <i>’Nchukos</i> are in attendance, and the latter lay out six small pebbles in the form of miniature
hearths in the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>, a piece of ceremonial for which the Lhotas can give no reason. The meat is then
all divided up, and the <i>Wokchungs</i> and <i>’Nchukos</i> first go into the house and cook and eat a little of the meat. Then the guests go
in and feast. For this day they are mostly the husbands of women of the sacrificer’s
clan, with a sprinkling of blood relations and senior men. At night, after much singing
of songs in which good wishes for the sacrificer are expressed, the guests disperse
and the <i>’Nchukos</i> throw away the six small pebbles. Next day about midday two small pigs provided by
the sacrificer are speared by the <i>Wokchungs</i> outside the house. The hindquarters of one are the perquisite of the parents of the
sacrificer’s wife. The rest of the meat is eaten in the evening, when all men of the
sacrificer’s clan in the village who have done the <i lang="njh">Shishang</i> “genna” collect round a fire outside his house and sing and drink his “madhu.” The
<i>Wokchungs</i> and <i>’Nchukos</i> each hold a cock and sing songs in which the good fortune of the sacrificer is desired.
The cocks are then killed and the meat divided among the guests. The rest of the evening
and most of the night is given up to singing and drinking, the old men especially
getting happier and happier and more and more boastful of the deeds of their youth.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Third Social “Genna.”</span> The third social “genna” is called <i lang="njh">Etha</i>. Nowadays the tendency is to combine it with the fourth social “genna” at which a
mithan is killed, or even omit it altogether. The procedure is much the same as that
of the <i lang="njh">Shishang</i> “genna,” except that Humtso, Chami, Kikung, Pathong and Nguli clans claim that they
alone have the right to sacrifice a bull, other clans being content with pigs. The
performance of this “genna” confers the right of wearing the cloth called <i lang="njh">ethasü</i>.
</p>
<p>After <i lang="njh">Etha</i> and all subsequent social “gennas” a ceremony called <i lang="njh">osoni-woala</i> is performed at the granary of the man who has done the sacrifice. The two <i>Wokchungs</i> sacrifice two pigs outside the granary, and kill two fowls by knocking their heads
against the door. The meat is then divided up and the fowls’ feathers are tied to
bamboos outside the granary as a sign that the ceremony has been performed there.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">The Fourth Social “Genna.”</span> The fourth social “genna” is that at which a mithan is killed (<i lang="njh">Tsirotsoala</i>). The man who proposes to perform this “genna” tells the two <i>Wokchungs</i> of his intention. The <i>Wokchungs</i> tell the husbands of married women born in the sacrificer’s clan, and they (the husbands)
in turn give public notice in the village and are called <i lang="njh">Wothang</i> (“announcers”). Rice is pounded, with much singing, and “madhu” prepared. On the
day of the sacrifice the mithan, which must be a bull without blemish, is tied up
in front of the sacrificer’s house, with its horns decked with <i lang="njh">rezüyo</i> leaves. It is given a drink of water and allowed to lick salt out of the hand of
the sacrificer’s wife. The <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i> touches it on the head with a stick and recites <i lang="njh">dranda</i>. It is thrown, and a spear thrust into its heart by an old man, not necessarily of
the sacrificer’s clan, who at once runs away while all present pelt him with lumps
of earth. After the mithan is dead its nose is pierced by the <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i> and a string of <i lang="njh">kuro</i> bark passed through and tied to a post in front of the house. The man performing
the “genna” then takes his dao in his left hand and draws it across the flanks and
neck of the animal as if he were cutting up the meat. He then cuts the string <span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>and walks widdershins round the mithan up to the door of his house, which he enters
after washing his hands and his dao. The meat is divided up as follows: the chest
to the clan of the performer of the sacrifice, the hindquarters to his wife’s clan,
the fore-legs to the husbands of women of his clan (<i lang="njh">echantyoi</i>), the meat of the head to the <i>Wothangs</i>, the tongue to the man who helped to buy the mithan, and the lower part of the stomach
to the old man who killed it. The performer must on no account eat any of this meat.
Probably he will avoid mithan meat altogether for a year, in case an enemy should
give him some of his own mithan to eat. The skull and horns must be kept in the “morung”
till the sacrificer has dragged a stone, when he is allowed to put them up in his
house.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Stone-dragging.</span> Before the ceremonies<a class="noteRef" id="n141.1src" href="#n141.1">21</a> begin a man who proposes to drag a stone must build a little shed at the back of
his house called <i lang="njh">emungrangki</i>, in which he and the whole household must sleep till the ceremonies are finished.
All being prepared and a stone selected, two <i>Wothangs</i> announce the date of the ceremony on behalf of the performer, who must allow no strangers
from other villages to enter his house, and must remain chaste from the time the stone
is dug out of the ground till the completion of the ceremonies. On the appointed night
rice is pounded in front of his house with much singing and “madhu” made after daybreak.
(Here and throughout, most of the work is done by the <i lang="njh">echantyoi</i>, i.e. husbands of women whom the performer calls “sister”). The “madhu” is put in
baskets to ferment and a bunch of green stuff called <i lang="njh">soko-mma</i> (“madhu-forbidding”) is put over the door.<a class="noteRef" id="n141.2src" href="#n141.2">22</a> On the fourth day after this the performer must feed the <i>Wokchungs</i> and <span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>their assistants in his house, receiving their blessing in return. The next day a
path is cleared for the stone, the workers being feasted on a large pig. On the following
day an old man called <i lang="njh">Lungchakdhro</i> kills a little chicken in front of the house by cutting its throat with a sharp piece
of bamboo, and prays that the stone may be carried up safely and unbroken. The chicken
is thrown away. Then the <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i> kills a small pig which is cooked by the performer’s <i lang="njh">echantyoi</i> in his <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>. Every man is given a piece. The older men eat their portions, but the younger men
only touch theirs and throw them down, for it is believed that they would become weak
and unable to lift the stone were they to eat this meat. Then all the men of the village,
both those of the performer’s clan and his <i lang="njh">echantyoi</i>, go down to the stone, which may be as far as two miles away, and make a frame of
bamboo, on which it is put and bound with cane and creepers. When all is ready the
two <i>Wothangs</i> sprinkle a mixture of “rohi madhu,” “saka madhu” and <i lang="njh">rarakham</i> in all directions and make a pretence of lifting the stone. These preliminaries over,
all take up the frame and carry<a class="noteRef" id="n142.1src" href="#n142.1">23</a> the stone with much ho-hoing and grunting up to a place on the path called <i lang="njh">züchanpen</i> (“stone-discussing-place”). There they are met by a procession of men in full dancing
dress, consisting of all men of the dragger’s clan who have dragged stones before,
the rear being brought up by the performer himself, followed by two men called <i lang="njh">Eso</i> and <i lang="njh">Yuso</i>, <i lang="njh">Eso</i> being the last man of the same clan who dragged a stone before the present puller,
and <i lang="njh">Yuso</i> the last dragger before <i lang="njh">Eso</i> of the same clan. The performer himself carries an axe wrapped in <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves, an egg and a chicken. After the inevitable interval for eating, drinking
and talking the senior <i lang="njh">Wokchung</i> holds the chicken in his hand and utters prayers for the prosperity of the village
in general and especially for that of the performer and his wife. He cuts the chicken’s
throat with a sharp piece of bamboo and places it with the egg <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>in front of the stone. The two <i>Wokchungs</i> and the performer then all hold the axe together and make eight cuts to the right
and eight to the left, as if clearing a way in front of the stone. The stone is then
carried up to the village and laid in front of the performer’s house. The evening
is spent in feasting and singing. The performer supplies a bull, which is killed and
divided up. The entrails are cooked and eaten by the carriers on the spot. The head
goes to the performer and the meat is distributed to all except the performer and
his clan and household. The songs sung are called <i lang="njh">orrüeya</i> (“enemy-songs”), and detail the heads taken from every hostile village in the neighbourhood.
The next day the <i>Wokchungs</i> show the exact place where the stone is to be set up and a hole is dug. All chant
a prayer for the good fortune of the performer, holding in their hands curious cups
of “madhu” made of folded plantain leaves ornamented with long horns of <i lang="njh">rezüyo</i> leaves, similar to the cups used by the Aos at their big sacrifices. Two boars are
then killed and cooked and eaten. A procession now emerges from the performer’s house
consisting of two old women followed by the performer’s wife wearing her <i lang="njh">charaksü</i> cloth for the first time, and another old woman. All four must wear their cloths
bound round them under the armpits and not over the shoulders. The four women walk
round the hole, which they approach from the side opposite to the Road of the Dead.
Each one waves her foot over the hole as she passes. They then wash their faces and
hands and re-enter the house. The stone is now tipped into the hole, set up and covered
with mats, and the rest of the day spent in feasting and gaiety. In the morning the
mats are removed and the ceremony is at an end. Among the Southern Lhotas three days
elapse between that on which the stone is dragged into the village and that on which
it is set up. During these three days the dragger is “genna.” He must not speak to
strangers or eat any unclean meat.<a class="noteRef" id="n143.1src" href="#n143.1">24</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p>Occasionally big forked posts (<i lang="njh">tsongzü</i>), ten or twelve feet high,<a class="noteRef" id="n144.1src" href="#n144.1">25</a> are put up instead of stones to commemorate a mithan sacrifice. The usual reason
is that suitable stone is not available, but the Nyimshamo kindred of the Othui clan
in Yekhum are a unique example of a kindred which is forbidden to set up stones and
must always set up posts instead. The reason given is simply that they have never
been allowed to have anything to do with the village oha. The kindred came from Yemkha
on the Sema border and may represent an immigration of Semas who still retain their
own customs, but there is no tradition to that effect.

<h3 class="main"><i>Birth.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In addition to the articles of food which women are forbidden to eat at all times,
there are certain other things which are prohibited during pregnancy. Neither the
woman nor her husband may eat tortoise or pangolin,<a class="noteRef" id="n144.2src" href="#n144.2">26</a> indeed she must not even touch a tortoise, and her husband, though he may touch one,
may not bring one into the house or allow anyone else to do so. The wife may not eat
bear’s meat or the kill of any wild animal, and if her husband eats any of these things
he must sleep apart from her the following <span class="pageNum" id="pb145">[<a href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>night. It is most important that neither the husband nor the wife should kill a snake
during this time. Were they to do so the expected child would have a tremulous tongue.
Some pregnant women even object to a snake being killed in their presence. It is also
forbidden to an expectant mother to cut her hair. Any hairs which fall out are carefully
collected and twisted into the hair-band. At the time of delivery the woman lies on
her side and is attended to by an old midwife called <i lang="njh">Oshangessi</i> (“thrower-away of afterbirth”). The husband and female relations may remain present.
The household goods are only put outside when delivery is delayed. In cases of very
painful birth the father either makes fire with a fire-stick and fumigates the woman,
or exchanges drinks of hot “rohi madhu” with her. Occasionally the father spits on
his fingers and puts a little of his saliva on the woman’s stomach. This is regarded
as an infallible remedy in cases of difficult delivery.<a class="noteRef" id="n145.1src" href="#n145.1">27</a> The <i lang="njh">Oshangessi</i>, the moment the child is born, calls it by some name other than that which is to
be its real name, in order that the evil spirits (<i lang="njh">tsandhramo</i>) who are listening at the door may be deceived and go away, thinking they are in
possession of the real name, which is not given till six days later in the case of
a boy and five days later in the case of a girl. The name finally chosen is invariably
one which has been borne by a member of the clan before. The false name having been
given, the <i lang="njh">Oshangessi</i> washes the child and puts a little boiled rice into its mouth. The navel string is
put into a “chunga” and carefully kept by the parents in their house. If it were thrown
away and eaten by a dog or pig or otherwise destroyed the child would die. The <i lang="njh">Oshangessi</i> wraps up the afterbirth in bits of rag and <i lang="njh">tsampen</i> (wild lemon) leaves in the case of a boy and <i lang="njh">michem</i> leaves in the case of a girl, and putting <span class="pageNum" id="pb146">[<a href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>it in a little basket hangs it up on a <i lang="njh">michem</i> tree, a tree with white flowers, well out of the way of dogs and pigs, who would
cause the death or serious illness of the child if they ate it. There is one such
tree on the outskirts of every “khel” which is used for afterbirths.<a class="noteRef" id="n146.1src" href="#n146.1">28</a>
</p>
<p>For the next six days in the case of a boy, or five days in the case of a girl, the
parents must not speak to any strangers, nor may any strangers come to the house.<a class="noteRef" id="n146.2src" href="#n146.2">29</a> Freshly killed meat too must not be brought into the house. For these days the child
is regarded as in a sense still in the process of being born. The custom until recently
was to regard a mother who died during this time as having died in childbirth,<a class="noteRef" id="n146.3src" href="#n146.3">30</a> and abandon the house and all its contents. At the end of five or six days as the
case may be the ceremony of first carrying the child is performed. Into the hands
of a son the father puts a miniature “madhu chunga” and wooden dao and says, “If I
go on the warpath, if I go hunting, if I go fishing, I will take you with me. Grow
up a strong, famous man.” He then places the child for a moment in a carrying cloth
on the back of the first “carrier” (<i lang="njh">Ngaromuchung</i>), who must be a boy for a male child and a girl for a female child, but may be of
any clan. For a daughter the father puts into her hands a miniature weaving sword
and belt and says, “If I go to the fields, if I go to pick leaves in the jungle, I
will take you with me. Grow up quickly and be strong.” She is then given to the <i lang="njh">Ngaromuchung</i> to carry for a minute. For the rest of that day the <i lang="njh">Ngaromuchung</i> must avoid going down the path by which the spirits of the dead leave the village,
in case he or she should unwittingly carry the child’s soul (<i lang="njh">omon</i>) with her. After the child has been carried by the <i lang="njh">Ngaromuchung</i> the lobes of the child’s ears are pierced with a sharp bamboo needle. The <i lang="njh">Oshangessi</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>usually does this, but if she is old and her hand unsteady the father drives the needle
through at the place indicated by her. A little plug of cotton wool is put in to prevent
the hole closing up.
</p>
<p>Boys are suckled for three years as a rule and girls for two, but a little “grown-ups’ ”
food is given from a very early age. Bat’s-flesh soup is considered to be a good tonic
for a child whom its mother cannot suckle properly for any reason. Within about a
month of birth the child is given its first taste of meat. If possible bulbul is given,
because this bird twitters so much that by eating it a child will soon learn how to
talk. Substitutes are a small fish called <i lang="njh">ngolelop</i>, or a species of cuckoo called <i lang="njh">liyosangsü</i>, which is said to be able to imitate the call of all birds and animals.
</p>
<p>As soon as the mother is well enough to take the child out of the house she cuts off
a little of its hair and either throws it away or wraps it in a leaf and keeps it.
The heads of little boys are shaved except for a little piece on the crown, which
is gradually allowed to increase until by the time he can run about his coiffure is
like that of a grown man. Little girls have the whole of their heads shaved till they
begin to wear a skirt, which is generally when they are five or six years old. It
is then allowed to grow, beginning in the spring, “so that it grows with the jungle,”
as one informant expressed it to the writer.

<h3 class="main"><i>Marriage.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Girls usually marry between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, and boys between seventeen
and twenty-two. The ceremonies are intricate and differ in the northern and southern
sections of the tribe. Among the Northern Lhotas the customary procedure is as follows.
A man having decided that he wishes to marry a certain girl, he tells his parents,
and either his mother or some elderly female relation goes and sounds the girl’s parents.
If they are agreeable she goes again with a “chunga” of “rohi madhu,” which they drink,
but by so doing do not bind <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>themselves to give their daughter in marriage. The marriage-price is then discussed
and settled by the two families, and the bridegroom gives the girl a rain-shield (<i lang="njh">phūchyo</i>), a small carrying-basket (<i lang="njh">eyingkhangdro</i>) and a dao handle.
</p>
<p>These preliminaries being satisfactorily settled, at the next <i lang="njh">Pikuchak</i> the ceremony of <i lang="njh">tsoyuta</i> (“eating and drinking”) takes place. The man takes a cock, which he has killed and
cooked himself, and some “madhu” rice, and goes to the girl’s parents’ house accompanied
by an old man of his clan called <i lang="njh">Hantsen</i>, and another male relative, a sort of best man. The <i lang="njh">Hantsen</i> enters the house first, then the bridegroom and then the best man. They hand the
“madhu” rice to the girl’s father, who in turn produces some. The rice of the two
families is mixed by the girl and a brew prepared from it which may be drunk by all
except the engaged couple. The bride and bridegroom sit side by side on the bed in
the <i lang="njh">lhurhui</i>, and the <i lang="njh">Hantsen</i> squats opposite to them, holding in each hand a leaf containing sixteen tiny scraps
of the cock which the bridegroom brought. He then swings his hands backwards and forwards
eight times, praying that the couple, who by this ceremony are made man and wife,
will live long and happily together. From this time the bridegroom will work in his
father-in-law’s house for about a year.<a class="noteRef" id="n148.1src" href="#n148.1">31</a> It is forbidden for him to have connection with his wife before <i lang="njh">tsoyuta</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n148.2src" href="#n148.2">32</a> To do so would, it is believed, cause the marriage to be sterile. But he may sleep
with her when working in her father’s house. When the fields have all been cut the
bridegroom’s relations stack a quantity of wood in the jungle, and bring up one load
each to the bride’s father’s house, receiving a drink of “madhu” for their trouble.
Four or five days later the <i lang="njh">lantsoa</i> (“road-making”) ceremony takes place. The husbands of women born in the bridegroom’s
<span class="pageNum" id="pb149">[<a href="#pb149">149</a>]</span>clan and their wives fetch up all the wood which was left stacked in the jungle and
heap it up in front of his father-in-law’s house. The bridegroom kills a pig and gives
about twelve pounds of meat to his father-in-law. That night in the latter’s house
the <i lang="njh">Hantsen</i> strangles a chicken and watches how the excreta fall. If any remains in the vent
it is an evil omen indicating that the woman will die in childbirth. The <i lang="njh">Hantsen</i> examines the entrails also, and from them claims to be able to say which will die
first, whether the first child will be a boy or a girl, and so on. The chicken is
then cooked by the <i lang="njh">Hantsen</i> and taken away as his perquisite. The married couple may watch, but must never say
afterwards what the omens revealed. Next day men of the bridegroom’s clan distribute
the wood heaped up in front of his father-in-law’s house among all members of the
father-in-law’s clan, being rewarded with shares of the twelve pounds of pork.
</p>
<p>The bridegroom still continues to work in his father-in-law’s house till the next
<i lang="njh">Tuku</i> comes round and the <i lang="njh">halam</i> ceremony puts an end to his rather laborious honeymoon. For this the bridegroom builds
a small house called <i lang="njh">kithandro</i>, and buys a big pig, which is speared through the heart with a sharp bamboo in front
of his parents’ house by the husbands of women born in his clan. It is taken to his
father-in-law’s house and there singed and cut up. The head goes to the bride’s father,
who also shares with other members of his clan the left fore- and hind-quarters. The
chest and right fore- and hind-legs are laid aside. The bride collects cotton from
all married women of her clan, and gives them shares of meat from the chest in exchange.
In the afternoon all women, married or unmarried, of her clan bring two bobbins of
thread each and are regaled with “madhu” in front of her father’s house, returning
to their houses at nightfall. At night men of the bridegroom’s clan make preparations
to escort the couple to their <i lang="njh">kithandro</i>, and collect and drink outside his father-in-law’s house, the bride and bridegroom
meanwhile remaining inside. The drinking over, they put some meat wrapped in leaves
and a “chunga” of “madhu” against the house and call out, “Let them <span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span>come. Any further talking can be done to-morrow. Any further talking can be done the
day after to-morrow. It is forbidden to come after cockcrow. If you do not let them
come now we will burn your house.” After they have been summoned in this way three
or four times the procession emerges: first the wife of a man of the bridegroom’s
clan, then the bridegroom in full dress, followed by the bride wearing her <i lang="njh">loroesü</i> (marriage cloth) for the first time, with the wife of another man of the bridegroom’s
clan bringing up the rear. The first and last woman must not be pregnant at the time.
Before leaving the house the couple each take in their hands a small piece of meat
of the pig which was killed earlier in the day and two pieces of thread. The husband
waves his spear widdershins round the hearth before leaving the house, a ritual act
of which the meaning is not known. They must both maintain absolute silence from the
time they take the meat and thread in their hands to the time the <i lang="njh">Hantsen</i> completes the ceremonies at the <i lang="njh">kithandro</i>, whither they are escorted by the bridegroom’s male relations. Four of these relations
stay behind, and after asking the way to the <i lang="njh">kithandro</i>—a mere pretence, of course—pick up the right fore- and hind-legs of the pig and take
them there, having let the bridal procession get well on its way first. The couple
find the <i lang="njh">Hantsen</i> waiting for them outside the <i lang="njh">kithandro</i>. He takes the bridegroom’s spear from him, jabs the butt into the ground and leaves
it standing outside the house. The meat and thread he takes into the house, and having
poured water over the couple’s hands leads them in. Standing in front of him, the
man to the right and the woman to the left, they genuflect to him eight times. They
may then speak and he leaves them. The couple sleep in the <i lang="njh">kithandro</i> that night, but sexual intercourse is forbidden, and two small boys of the bridegroom’s
clan sleep with them. In the morning the boys go down to fetch water, talking loudly
all the way, for it would be a very bad omen were they to meet a squirrel or other
wild animal on the way. During the day neither of the couple may go to the wife’s
father’s house. On the third day <span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span>they go with a present of meat, and are feasted there in return.<a class="noteRef" id="n151.1src" href="#n151.1">33</a>
</p>
<p>Three or four days later the ceremonies are completed by the <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> (“man-and-wife-magicians”). After a drink of “rohi madhu” the couple go into the
jungle alone and bring up a load of <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves and sixty-four small bamboo “chungas” in eight equal bundles. All are cut
on the slant except two in different bundles, which are cut with a level rim and are
called <i lang="njh">tsungta</i>. In each “chunga” of the two bundles containing <i lang="njh">tsungta</i> are put eight pieces of <i lang="njh">shambuk</i> pith and eight pieces of <i lang="njh">shamburi</i> pith. When this has been brought the two <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> are called to the house. They are two old women, wives or widows of men whom the
bridegroom calls <i lang="njh">aporamo</i>, and who have dragged a stone. These are given a full “chunga” of “rohi” to drink
and proceed to tie up little scraps of pork in <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves. They make four parcels each containing four scraps of meat, four each containing
six, four each containing eight, four each containing ten, and finally two each containing
thirty. These little parcels they put in a basket with a “chunga” of “rohi.” Then
each throttles a cock and watches the position of its legs when it dies. If the right
leg is down and the left up the husband will die first. If the right is up and the
left down the wife will die first. If the legs are crossed the couple will quarrel.
The excreta and entrails are also examined in the usual way. The husband then singes
the cocks and cuts each in half slantwise, so that the head is in one half and the
vent in the other. He puts <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves on the ground on his right and left, and puts the halves of two different
cocks on each. These are wrapped in leaves and put in the load with the pork and “madhu.”
Then all wash their hands and the <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> put eight narrow strips of plantain leaf over each ear of the bride and bridegroom,
who sit down in front of them, the husband to the right and the wife to the left.
The elder of <span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>the <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> next takes a small basket and puts into it a pair of pewter bracelets and waves it
in front of the couple, while she mumbles a prayer that they may be happy and have
many children. Only women know the right prayer, which is mumbled purposely in order
to prevent the husband hearing it properly. The prayer finishes with “hohoho” said
eight times, the other <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> keeping count aloud. From the house the old women go to the <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsentung</i> (“<i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> tree”) belonging to the “khel,” taking with them the basket containing the parcels
of pork and chicken and the “madhu,” and four bundles of bamboo “chungas,” eight <i lang="njh">yutso</i> leaves without blemish, an egg, and two garments which have been worn by the husband
and wife respectively. The old women are supposed to lead away with them all evil
spirits. It is therefore considered very unlucky to meet them and their devilish train
on their way. When they leave the <i lang="njh">kithandro</i> the wife shuts the door quickly behind them in order to keep out evil spirits and
keep in good. Arrived at the tree the elder <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> divides the “chungas” into two equal heaps and puts the egg between them, with a
parcel containing thirty pieces of meat on each side. They then go to the younger
<i>Ponyiratsen’s</i> house, and having divided up the rest of the meat there the elder one goes home.
That night the couple for whom the ceremony is being done must sleep apart.
</p>
<p>Next day the <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> come again and take the omens in the same way, except that two hens are used instead
of two cocks. After swinging the basket containing the bracelets and mumbling the
charm, the elder <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> lays a bamboo mat on the ground outside the door on the side farthest away from the
Road of the Dead. By the mat she lays the two worn garments which she took the day
before, the husband’s to the right and the wife’s to the left. She sits at the right
end of the mat, facing her assistant <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i>, who sits at the left end, and rolls an egg along the mat. Omens are drawn from the
direction in which the pointed end lies when it comes to rest. If it points towards
a hostile village the husband will get heads, if towards the plains money, if towards
the house rice. It is <span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>a very bad omen if it points towards the Road of the Dead. The assistant <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> rolls the egg back and the process is repeated eight times. A sickle is then slid
along the mat eight times and omens are taken from the direction of its point, just
as they were taken from the direction of the pointed end of the egg. When this is
finished the elder <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> shakes the two cloths eight times each to get rid of any evil there may be in them
and returns them to their owners, and as she picks up the mat, gives it a flick and
sends the egg, which is still lying on it, as far as possible in the direction opposite
to that of the Road of the Dead, saying as she does so, “I am throwing away all evil
fortune and poverty.” She then shakes the mat eight times, and both the <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> go to their own houses. The wife rolls up the mat and stands it on end inside the
door between the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> and the <i lang="njh">lhurhui</i>. The couple must sleep apart that night, and the mat must not be removed before cockcrow
next morning. This ceremony of the <i lang="njh">Ponyiratsen</i> is regarded by Lhotas as a sort of initiation into married life. It is only performed
for each individual once in his life. For example, were a bachelor to marry a widow
it would be performed for him. Were a married man to take a spinster as a second wife
it would be performed for her. But were a married man to take a widow it would not
be performed at all.
</p>
<p>Among the Southern Lhotas there are certain differences of detail. The first ambassador
is usually an old man of the bridegroom’s clan. If the girl’s parents drink the offered
“madhu” negotiations are considered to have begun. Later the old man brings a present
of meat and “madhu” and says, “This is so-and-so’s meat and ‘madhu.’ Will you eat
and drink it?” If the girl’s parents say, “Yes,” the couple are regarded as engaged,
and the man will help in his future father-in-law’s fields and make himself generally
useful, though he sleeps with his parents till after <i lang="njh">tsoyuta</i>. For that ceremony the bridegroom prepares “madhu” and kills and cuts up a pig, and
goes to the girl’s father’s house accompanied either by an old man of his clan and
an old woman of the girl’s clan or <i>vice versa</i>. The old woman enters the house first, followed by the old man, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>bridegroom bringing up the rear. The girl’s parents offer “madhu” to the old man and
woman, drinking in turn some of the “madhu” which has been brought. It is not mixed
as among the Northern Lhotas. The engaged couple sit on the bed in the <i lang="njh">lhurhui</i>, the man to the right and the woman to the left. The old man and woman sit opposite
to them, each holding a leaf containing six pieces of the pork they have brought,
and all four swing their arms backwards and forwards, while the old man and woman
say, “Live long and have many children.” The <i lang="njh">lantsoa</i> ceremony is performed as among the Northern Lhotas. For the <i lang="njh">halam</i> ceremony a few details are different. The bride and bridegroom are accompanied to
the <i lang="njh">kithandro</i>, not by two women, but by an old man of the bridegroom’s clan and the wife of a man
of his clan. The bridegroom does not wave his spear round the hearth, but carries
six pieces of meat and six bobbins of thread, while his wife carries five pieces of
meat and five bobbins of thread, which the old man takes from the bridegroom’s hand,
and the old woman from the bride’s hand. There is no <i lang="njh">Hantsen</i> as among the Northern Lhotas.
</p>
<p>A well-to-do Lhota usually has two or often three wives. Very occasionally a man will
have four or even five. All are of equal status, though the oldest wife naturally
occupies a position of some authority in the household. The husband usually sleeps
with her in the middle room. It is forbidden for him to have connection with more
than one wife on the same night. Possibly a vestige of a former system of group marriage
is found in the custom of a Lhota who expects to be away from home for some time giving
his brother permission to have marital relations with his wife during his absence.<a class="noteRef" id="n154.1src" href="#n154.1">34</a> On a man’s death his widow or widows are expected to go to his brother, who will
not, however, receive them into his house till all the ornaments on the dead man’s
grave <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>have been cleared away and he has finally gone to the Land of the Dead. A man who
thus takes his dead brother’s wife performs no marriage ceremony and pays no marriage
price. If the woman marries a man of another clan, the late husband’s clan realize
from the new husband a marriage price equal to the original marriage price. If a woman
does not wish to marry again she may keep one of her husband’s mithan heads instead
of putting it on his grave. This is equivalent to a vow of perpetual widowhood.
</p>
<p>The money which is paid by the husband for his wife is known collectively as <i lang="njh">oman</i> (marriage-price), but is divided into a number of items. The first payment of all
is known as <i lang="njh">chüka</i>, and is paid not to the girl’s parents, but to her mother’s father or mother’s brother.
The amount is Re. 1. This is paid as soon as <i lang="njh">tsoyuta</i> has taken place. The second item is <i lang="njh">nzuiman</i> (Rs. 8 to Rs. 10), paid to the girl’s parents as the cost of bringing her up. Thirdly
comes <i lang="njh">nvaman</i> (Rs. 10), the price of not working in his father-in-law’s house. The fourth payment
is <i lang="njh">kitsoman</i> (Rs. 2), the price of not building his father-in-law’s house. The third and fourth
items are of course only paid in cases where the bridegroom prefers to pay compensation
rather than work in his father-in-law’s house. The fifth item is <i lang="njh">halamman</i>, the cost of the pork given to the father-in-law at the <i lang="njh">halam</i> ceremony. The sixth is <i lang="njh">tsangchüman</i> (Rs. 2), paid in cases where the bridegroom does not distribute wood to members of
his father-in-law’s clan. The seventh is <i lang="njh">sontsoman</i> (four annas), paid if the bridegroom does not build a granary for his father-in-law.
The eighth is <i lang="njh">tsoroman</i> (Re. 1), the price of the bride’s breasts, and the ninth <i lang="njh">lentamoman</i> (Re. 1), price of intimacy with the bride. Men with land usually let the girl’s parents
cut one field once. If not, a tenth payment of one rupee or two rupees is made instead.
The eleventh item is <i lang="njh">otyai-etsoman</i> (the price of feeding the bride’s brothers), the marriage-price proper. This is shared
by the girl’s father and brothers. It amounts to about two hundred and fifty baskets
of rice, or thirty rupees if paid in cash. The rice or money is paid in instalments,
often at long intervals. The result is that it is by no means <span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>uncommon to find a son paying off the last instalment of his old widowed mother’s
marriage-price. Should a woman die without children her husband makes a final payment
varying from two rupees to five rupees, called <i lang="njh">etchhiman</i> (“price of death”). Once they have received <i lang="njh">etchhiman</i> the girl’s parents can claim no further instalments of <i lang="njh">otyai-etsoman</i>. If the woman dies leaving children a payment of one or two rupees, called <i lang="njh">mingishi</i>, is made to her parents or their heirs, who can in this case claim any of the <i lang="njh">otyai-etsoman</i> which may be outstanding.

<h3 class="main"><i>Divorce.</i></h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no ceremony connected with divorce as there is among the Aos, and the proceedings
are not protracted, the wife generally settling the matter by running away to the
house either of her parents or some admirer. In that case all that remains to be done
is to discuss the return of the marriage-price. Sometimes the girl’s parents return
the full amount of the marriage-price which they have received up to date, plus a
fine of ten rupees, and sometimes, in cases where the marriage-price has already been
divided up and spent, it is arranged that the aggrieved husband shall recover the
marriage-price from whoever marries his runaway wife. In cases where the woman runs
off with another man the co-respondent has to pay the husband the full amount of the
marriage-price, plus compensation amounting to fifty or a hundred rupees. It is very
rarely that a man simply turns his wife out. If he does so he cannot recover his marriage-price
and has to pay her parents or their heirs a fine of ten rupees. He naturally, therefore,
puts up with a good deal from his wife, sooner than lose his marriage-price. Among
the Aos the divorced wife can claim a share of the household store of grain. Among
the Lhotas she can only claim the thread and chickens she brought with her at her
marriage or their equivalent, together with the clothes she wears and all the thread
there may be in the house. Any ornaments given her by her husband must be returned
to him.

<h3 class="main"><i>Death Ceremonies.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In cases where the death agony is prolonged the Changs <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>cut a carrying-string on the threshold of the house in order to release the spirit,
but there appears to be no such practice among the Lhotas. At death the nearest relation
present closes the eyes and washes the face of the corpse. No hole is made in the
roof to let the spirit out as among the Konyaks. A very old man ties a cowrie to a
chicken’s leg and places it for a moment in the dead man’s hand. He then kills it
in order that it may go clucking along the Road of the Dead and give warning that
the deceased is coming. It is hung by the neck above the head of the corpse, and after
the burial the wings are cut off and stuck up on the left wall of the house and the
body either thrown away or given to the buriers (<i lang="njh">mungpen</i>) to eat. When the deceased is a man who has taken heads, or killed a tiger, a dog
is led into the house on a string and the string put into the hand of the corpse for
a minute. After the body has been buried the dog is killed in order that it may go
barking down the Road of the Dead and frighten away the ghosts of enemies and tigers
slain by the dead man during his lifetime. The flesh is eaten by the <i lang="njh">mungpen</i>. The corpse is buried as soon after death as possible. A grave about six feet deep
is dug in front of the man’s house. The body is buried fully dressed, and often decorated
with all the ornaments worn during life, if the deceased so desired. Nothing of foreign
manufacture may be worn by a corpse. A cornelian bead is tied to the dead man’s wrist
to give to a spirit called <i lang="njh">Etchhilivanthamo</i>, whom he will meet on the Road of the Dead, in exchange for a drink of water. Among
the Northern Lhotas a sharp piece of bamboo is also put under the head of the corpse
at the time of burial, in order that the soul of <span class="corr" id="xd31e7859" title="Not in source">the </span>deceased may be able to cut any creepers which he may find obstructing his way. The
body is wrapped in two or three good cloths and carried out of the house by the <i lang="njh">mungpen</i>. Over it in the grave are put short lengths of bamboo laid crosswise, and on them
two planks from the dead man’s bed, which are in turn covered with a piece of bamboo
matting. In certain villages of the Northern Lhotas rich men were till recently buried
in wooden coffins called “boats” (<i lang="njh">orhung</i>), cut out of one log of wood, with a rude representation of a hornbill’s head and
tail at the head <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>and foot respectively.<a class="noteRef" id="n158.1src" href="#n158.1">35</a> It is noticeable that they were made in villages which do not make dug-out canoes,<a class="noteRef" id="n158.2src" href="#n158.2">36</a> or indeed anything more serviceable than a type of bamboo raft which “floats” about
six inches under water. These coffins took a considerable time to make and were begun
as soon as the illness took a bad turn. If a man recovered after his coffin had been
made he was supposed to live a long time.<a class="noteRef" id="n158.3src" href="#n158.3">37</a>
</p>
<p>Stones and thorns are heaped on the top of the grave to prevent pigs and dogs scratching
up the earth, and a low fence is built round it. Two bamboo posts are then put up,
one at the head and one at the foot, with a cross-bar between them. In the case of
a man’s grave a basket containing a gourd of “madhu,” a little boiled rice and six
pieces of meat is hung on the post at the head. His wooden dao-holder, and bear’s-hair
wig, cloth, cowrie lengta, ivory armlets, etc., are hung on the cross-bar, and his
spears are stuck upright on the grave. In the case of a woman’s grave only the basket
is hung at the head, containing five instead of six pieces of meat. A fire is lighted
on the grave. For six days after the death of a man and five days after the death
of a woman no member of the household must speak to a stranger or kill any living
thing. When this period of “genna” is over the man’s possessions are removed from
the grave, and imitation spears, or very old ones, put in their place. On the cross-bar
above the grave round bamboo basket balls are put to represent the number of times
the deceased has done the head-taking “genna.” Sometimes roughly carved wooden heads
are used. Tigers made from a short length of bamboo, with short bamboo “legs” and
“tail,” commemorate his prowess in the chase.<a class="noteRef" id="n158.4src" href="#n158.4">38</a> On this <span class="pageNum" id="pb159">[<a href="#pb159">159</a>]</span>day the wings of the “death chicken” are taken down from the wall, and cut with a
dao on the step between <i lang="njh">mpongki</i> and <i lang="njh">lhurhui</i>, six times for a man and five times for a woman, and a prayer is offered that the
dead person will not haunt the house, and in the case of a man who has taken heads
a mithan and a pig are sacrificed by his clan. For a woman, or a man who has not taken
heads, only a pig is sacrificed. The fire is kept alight on the grave and the offerings
of food are renewed until the <i lang="njh">tuku emung</i>, when the dead man is supposed finally to take his departure to the Land of the Dead,
and all ornaments being removed the grave becomes part of the village street again.
</p>
<p>Offerings to the dead are made not only on the grave, but also by the side of the
path from the village which leads to the Land of the Dead under Wokha Hill. Immediately
after death two relations, calling upon the dead man to follow them, go down the path,
taking with them a gourd of “madhu” and a stick nicked to show the “gennas” the deceased
has performed and the heads he has taken. The stick is stuck up by the side of the
path and the gourd tied to it. These are to support and refresh the deceased on his
way. When the six days of “genna” are over, in the case of a man, a bamboo erection
(<i lang="njh">nritangpeng</i>) is put up by the side of the path, with tallies of heads taken and tigers slain
such as are put on the grave. On the memorial of one mighty hunter the writer saw
two elephants made of black cloth stuffed with straw. For a man who has done no “gennas”
a single bamboo pole is put up. On the <i lang="njh">tuku emung</i>, when all ornaments are removed from the grave, the final offerings are made by the
side of the path.<a class="noteRef" id="n159.1src" href="#n159.1">39</a> The relations go out before dawn, and for a man erect a little bamboo platform or
tiny altar composed of a small flat stone supported on little bits of bamboo. On it
are laid six pieces of meat and some rice and scraps of any favourite <span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>fruit of the deceased. A new dao-belt, with a miniature dao-holder, is stretched between
two sticks, and a little wooden dao and spear are put near it. Sometimes a little
bamboo platform (<i lang="njh">eno</i>) with a little notched stick for the ghost to use as a ladder<a class="noteRef" id="n160.1src" href="#n160.1">40</a> is put up, and on it are laid ear ornaments and offerings of food and drink, and
imitation beads made from pith. This offering made, the living have performed their
duty towards the dead, and the village can begin a new year with little fear of hauntings.<a class="noteRef" id="n160.2src" href="#n160.2">41</a>

<p>Such are the usual funeral ceremonies, but under certain circumstances the normal
procedure is not followed. An infant is usually buried in the <i lang="njh">mpongki</i>, the reason given being the rather pathetic one that its parents do not like to think
of it lying out in the rain and the cold. If a man was killed in war he was buried
outside the village and no ornaments were put on his grave. Like all Nagas, the Lhotas
regard certain forms of death with horror, as being manifestations of supernatural
displeasure.<a class="noteRef" id="n160.3src" href="#n160.3">42</a> Thus it is that when anyone dies by drowning, or by falling from a tree, or by fire,
or by accidentally falling on his own spear, or in childbirth, or is killed by a wild
animal, very strict purificatory <span class="corr" id="xd31e7948" title="Source: rights">rites</span> have to be performed, and great care is taken to burn or cut down a tree from which
a man has fallen and been killed. Except in the case of a man killed by a tiger or
leopard the corpse is buried near the place of death, whether inside or outside the
village. An account of the rites following a death by drowning will illustrate the
procedure followed. The body is buried by the nearest relations present, no bead being
put on the wrist or ornaments on the grave. Anyone who touches the corpse must at
the first opportunity throw away all ornaments and clothing he was wearing at the
time. Other people present need not do more than throw <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>away a thread from their clothes and the cotton wool from their ears, and scrape a
shaving off their spears and dao handles. Any fish caught before the man was drowned,
if the catastrophe took place while fishing, as is often the case, may be cooked and
eaten on the spot, but nothing must be carried away. Each man as he leaves the river
flicks the water with his right hand and says, “Take away all evil, O river.” As soon
as the news of the disaster, for such it is, reaches the village an old man comes
out and makes a fire on the path, using a fire-stick to do so. Every man before he
can enter the village must step through the smoke of the fire, and hold his ornaments
and weapons in it for a moment.<a class="noteRef" id="n161.1src" href="#n161.1">43</a> Someone is standing ready with a “chunga” of water, and each man washes his hands
before he passes on. Even a stranger from another village must do this before he can
enter his own village, lest he should bring with him the evil with which he is contaminated.
The house and all the property of the dead man are abandoned. His money is simply
thrown on the ground and left there. His live-stock cannot be killed, for that would
defile the dao. The animals are just left to wander about, or are driven over a cliff
if they become a nuisance.<a class="noteRef" id="n161.2src" href="#n161.2">44</a> No money or debts in kind due to the dead man can be claimed, and his heirs in turn
need not pay any of his debts. His house is left to fall into ruins with all it contains.
His crops are abandoned and any land he was cutting that year must next be cut by
a man of another <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>clan, though an old man of the dead man’s clan may take rent for it. For the purification
of the members of the household the following rites are performed among the Northern
Lhotas. Friends of the dead man build a little shed and put some clothes and food
in it. An old man of his clan, on the day after the death, lights a fire in front
of the house and sacrifices a cock. The whole household must then come out of the
house stark naked and step over the fire. They then enter the shed, where they put
on clothes and remain for six days without speaking to anyone. Friends bring them
food, and build a new house for them. Among the Southern Lhotas the usual custom is
for the household to remain in the old house for six days. A cock is then sacrificed,
and they pass through the fire and wash their hands and feet and go to a little house
built for them outside the village, where they remain for six days, being fed by their
friends. They then again are made to pass through the fire and change their clothes
and wash and have their hair cut, after which they are ceremonially clean. The task
of the man who sacrifices the chicken is regarded as a particularly risky one. Lhotas
near the Sema border usually call in a Sema to perform this unpleasant duty. The Sema
is not over nice in these matters and willingly sacrifices the chicken, receiving
as his reward any of the live-stock of the deceased which he likes to kill and carry
away. He must not, however, take away beads or money which might pass from hand to
hand and eventually reach some Lhota. The people of Yekhum were recently very much
distressed because some Semas carried off some money which had been thrown away, and
complained that they would not know whether any rupee in circulation was from this
tainted source or not. If a man is killed by a tiger or leopard the body is not buried,
but is put on a platform in a tree and panjis are set underneath. This is the only
example of tree “burial” among the Lhotas,<a class="noteRef" id="n162.1src" href="#n162.1">45</a> though the Aos invariably lay out their dead on machans, and the Konyaks beyond them
actually put their dead <span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>bodies in trees in certain villages. Such horror have the Lhotas of being killed by
wild beasts that if a man who is being chased by an elephant throws down his load
and the elephant touches it he may never pick it up again, for it “belongs to the
elephant,” and were he to take it back some elephant would assuredly take his life
in exchange. Similarly the shaft of a spear broken by a tiger may never be used again,
or the owner will have to give his life in exchange for the spear. No direct descendant
of a man killed by a tiger or leopard may eat meat from a tiger or leopard’s kill
until he has removed the curse by cutting off the head of a tiger. The wife of a man
under this prohibition must observe it, but the husband of a woman under it may eat
meat from a kill, but must not give it to his wife. No one may eat the flesh of an
animal which has been drowned, or has died in giving birth to young. Were Lhotas strictly
logical they would prohibit the eating of meat from a tiger’s or leopard’s kill. As
it is, it is regarded as unclean and meat is prohibited for anyone who has to remain
ceremonially clean. Ordinarily, however, it may be eaten, for to forbid it entirely
would be a great hardship in a country where such large numbers of live-stock come
to this untimely end. Lightning, as is only natural, is looked upon as an instrument
of supernatural vengeance. Even if no one be killed, a house struck by lightning is
abandoned with all it contains. A tree struck by lightning cannot be cut up for firewood
or used for any purpose whatever. Should a field be struck, no crop is cut that year
from the place where the lightning fell. The rest of the crop may be eaten, but no
seed is kept from that field. The stone adzes which are sometimes found are regarded
as thunderbolts and are called <i lang="njh">Potsophü</i> (“<i>Potsos’</i> axes”), and no Lhota cares to touch one.

<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Medicine Men.</span> Some Lhotas say that the peculiar powers believed to be possessed by medicine men
(<i lang="njh">ratsen</i>) are hereditary.<a class="noteRef" id="n163.1src" href="#n163.1">46</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb164">[<a href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>Most people hold, however, that anyone, man or woman, is liable to develop the symptoms
which are associated with <i lang="njh">ratsen</i>. The person affected falls into a fit at the dark of the moon, and while in this
state says that friends are coming, though none of the bystanders can see anything.
These fits are liable to occur throughout life at the change of the moon, and are
certainly very violent. I myself saw Yimbomo of Rephyim, a well-known <i lang="njh">ratsen</i>, fall into a sudden fit down at the Doyang river when a large number of men were
“poisoning” the water for fish. He laughed and shouted incoherently, and kept throwing
himself onto the ground with such violence, that two men had to be told off to restrain
him. In order to bring a man round from these fits powdered ginger is blown into his
nose and ears. When a man shows these symptoms for the first time an experienced <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> is called in to diagnose the case. If he proclaim it to be genuine he strangles a
cock, from the head of which he is believed to extract a small stone called <i lang="njh">ratse’ha</i>. This stone he gives to the budding <i lang="njh">ratsen</i>, who is supposed to keep it inside his head, and occasionally even show it to very
intimate friends. It is said that a few years ago ’Ntengo of Lungsachung was foolish
enough to show his stone to a rival <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> called Khumeshiyo of the same village, who grabbed it and managed to retain possession
of it. The result was that ’Ntengo went mad and died soon afterwards.

</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Every <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> possesses a “familiar” (<i lang="njh">sonyo</i>), which is usually a leopard,<a class="noteRef" id="n164.1src" href="#n164.1">47</a> but occasionally a snake. The Lhotas are perfectly familiar with the “leopard men”
who are found among the Semas, and clearly distinguish them from their own <i lang="njh">ratsen</i>. They say that the soul of the Sema “leopard man” actually enters his leopard, while
the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>is merely very intimately connected with his <i lang="njh">sonyo</i>, which is an ordinary leopard indistinguishable in form from other leopards. If,
however, the <i lang="njh">sonyo</i> of a <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> is killed the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> will sicken and perhaps die unless he can get another. As the powers of the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> grow so his <i lang="njh">sonyo</i> increases in size, until in time it may even become unmanageable. This happened to
a <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> from Akuk called Mungchemo. His leopard became so big and fierce that he begged the
villagers to kill it. They ringed it, but Mungchemo, who was helping, shouted in his
excitement and so gave the leopard sufficient warning for it to escape. This failure
to get rid of his <i lang="njh">sonyo</i> so weighed on his mind that he eventually committed suicide. Ordinarily, however,
the <i lang="njh">sonyo</i> is believed to be under such excellent control that its owner can call it up from
the jungle at will. This he rarely does, however, for if another man sees his <i lang="njh">sonyo</i> the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> becomes ill. There are numerous stories, however, of leopards having been seen actually
in <i>ratsens’</i> houses. Naturally a <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> ordinarily objects strongly to his <i lang="njh">sonyo</i> being killed, for it may entail his own death. The result is that several villages
have told their <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> that since he cannot stop his leopard killing their pigs they cannot allow him to
be present when they ring the leopard, for at leopard hunts the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> is supposed to warn the quarry either by shouting to it or spitting on bits of worm-cast
and throwing them towards it. In some places if a <i>ratsen’s</i> leopard is hunted and killed he lays a cloth over the body as a mark of respect.
The fits from which a <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> suffers are believed to be in some way connected with his <i lang="njh">sonyo</i>. They usually occur at the dark of the moon, at which time he has most influence
over his leopard, and when he falls in a fit the soul of the leopard is believed to
walk over his body. The soul is of course invisible, but visible tracks are supposed
occasionally to be left on the <i>ratsen’s</i> chest.
</p>
<p>In addition to the ordinary food taboos a <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> is forbidden to eat bamboo rats, frogs, or king-crows. They are supposed to be able
to foretell the future by gazing into “madhu,” or water held in a leaf, but their
chief occupation in life is to “extract” foreign bodies from the persons <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>of sick people. This is always done inside a house where the bad light makes sleight
of hand easy. The patient is rubbed with a leaf, usually a wild lemon leaf, upon which
the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> repeatedly spits. Finally he will show the patient a small pebble or a bit of leaf
or hair, which he says was causing all the trouble by lodging in the body. In cases
of laboured breathing the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> says that there is a hole in the lungs. He then by sleight of hand makes a leaf seem
to disappear into the patient’s chest, and after a few minutes extracts it and announces
that the hole is now stopped up. Coughs are usually cured by pretending to extract
a lump of hair from the throat. Usually the foreign body which is extracted is simply
thrown away anywhere, but in cases of rheumatism, which is regarded as in some way
especially connected with lightning, the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> “extracts” bits of wood from the patient’s joints and throws them away near a tree
which has been struck by lightning. Into the trunk of the tree he sticks a piece of
iron, which he leaves there, and throws down one or two eggs as an offering. Often
the <i lang="njh">ratsen</i> will say that the illness is due not to the presence of a foreign body, but to the
capture of the patient’s soul by an evil spirit. He will then announce the whereabouts
of the evil spirit in question, and the appropriate ceremonies must be performed.
These have been described under the section on private ceremonies.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Luck-stones.</span> The Lhota believes that certain stones called <i lang="njh">oha</i> bring good fortune. They are smooth, water-worn stones, varying in size from that
of a man’s head to that of a walnut, and are kept either under the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i>, or at the foot of the carved post of the “morung,” or by individuals in their houses
or granaries. <i lang="njh">Ratsen</i>, however, as has been mentioned above, are believed to have the peculiar habit of
keeping their <i lang="njh">oha</i> inside their heads. Those kept under the <i lang="njh">mingetung</i> are usually large, and on them the luck of the whole village depends. Those kept
in the “morung” affect the prosperity of the section of the village to which they
belong. Stones of these two classes have been handed down from generation to generation
and are never added <span class="pageNum" id="pb167">[<a href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>to nowadays, though they are believed occasionally to increase spontaneously. But
individuals still from time to time find small <i lang="njh">oha</i> in the jungle and bring them home to keep as private luck-stones. The distinguishing
mark of an <i lang="njh">oha</i> is that it should be round and smooth, and be found resting on the ground in a little
nest it has made for itself.<a class="noteRef" id="n167.1src" href="#n167.1">48</a> Anyone finding such a stone brings it home, and then notices whether his family increases
quickly, or he has good crops, or is particularly successful in trade. He thus finds
out what particular form of good luck is attached to the stone in question. Bad <i lang="njh">oha</i> are not unknown. One kind called <i lang="njh">ekyulung</i> (“coughing-stones”) causes the owner to fall ill. Yet to throw them away would mean
certain death. The possessor of an <i lang="njh">oha</i> which brings luck in trade keeps it with his money. Similarly a rice <i lang="njh">oha</i> is kept in the granary. A famous <i lang="njh">oha</i> is the <i lang="njh">Phi-tsong-lung</i> (“drying-increasing-stone”), which is in the possession of a member of the Othui
clan at Pangti. It is said to be a portion of the famous stone at Kezakenoma,<a class="noteRef" id="n167.2src" href="#n167.2">49</a> called by the Lhotas Ketsarhontsü, which miraculously increased rice dried on it,
and was broken off by Rangti, grandson of Longchentang, who according to one tradition
came out of the earth and founded the Mipongsandri phratry. This was before the Angamis,
Semas, Rengmas and Lhotas split up and became separate tribes. Formerly the Othui
clan used to provide one of the <i>Puthis</i> at Pangti, and the <i lang="njh">Puthi</i> of the Othui clan always used the <i lang="njh">Phi-tsong-lung</i> as a pounder for husking the rice at the ceremony of eating the first-fruits (<i lang="njh">mshe etak</i>). There are only a few broken fragments of the stone left now, which are kept with
other oha in the possessor’s granary. <i lang="njh">Oha</i> are treated with great respect. The ceremony connected with them at the <i lang="njh">Oyantsoa</i> “genna” has already been described. Before <span class="pageNum" id="pb168">[<a href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>doing the <i lang="njh">Liritang</i> ceremony at the beginning of harvest a man must make a small offering of meat to
his <i lang="njh">oha</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="n168.1src" href="#n168.1">50</a> At the time of the <i lang="njh">Pikuchak</i> “genna,” too, all possessors of rice <i lang="njh">oha</i> must inspect them, taking care to wash their hands both before and after. It is curious
that the reason given why the Nyimshamo kindred of the Othui clan in Yekhum cannot
set up stones after doing the mithan sacrifice, is that they have never been allowed
to touch the village <i lang="njh">oha</i>, when they had to be carried on migration, or indeed to have had anything to do with
<i lang="njh">oha</i>. What the connection is, however, between the two kinds of stone is not precisely
stated.

<p><span class="marginnote">Charms.</span> Love potions are commonest in the villages near the plains. I remember a youthful
widow of Sanis who was so indiscreet as to get engaged to two men in two different
villages at the same time. When the tangle was brought to me to unravel she said she
really had only meant to get engaged to one, but the other one had rubbed a love charm
on her neck—at least she thought that was what he must have done, though she had not
actually noticed him do so.
</p>
<p>Certain old women are supposed to possess the knowledge of these charms, which is
handed down from mother to daughter. One Amhono of Pyangsa is said to retail a root
called <i lang="njh">loha</i>, which has to be ground up and given to the shy loved one with cooked fish.<a class="noteRef" id="n168.2src" href="#n168.2">51</a> If the suit is hopeless the recipient of the root removes all doubt by being sick
on the spot. My informant had never seen the root; he had only heard of it. Another
charm is a feather of a bird called <i lang="njh">tsentsü</i>—probably mythical, at least I could never find out what it was. If a man can once
touch a woman’s hand with this she is his for life.
</p>
<p>Witchcraft, in the evil sense of the word, was probably never common among the Lhotas,
though the practice used to exist of making a straw image of an enemy in another village,
and after addressing it by name spearing it. This, however, could never be done by
one Lhota to another. <span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>It is believed to be possible, too, to bewitch a man by calling a stone or bit of
wood by his name and cursing it. This belief in the power given by knowledge of a
man’s name is of course world-wide, and among the Lhotas gives rise to the custom
of giving a false name at birth in order that the lurking evil spirits may go away
thinking they have the real name. Besides their ordinary name most, if not all, Lhotas
have a private name which is never revealed to any but relations or intimate friends.
If two men bear the same name they regard themselves as bound together by a particularly
close tie and address each other as <i lang="njh">akam</i>. Similarly Lhotas are particular that no enemy should get hold of bits of their hair
or clippings from their finger or toe nails. While the Naga Labour Corps were on their
way back from France some Lhotas planned to offer to cut some Semas’ hair for them,
and do “genna” with the clippings when they got home.<a class="noteRef" id="n169.1src" href="#n169.1">52</a> The plan was only just vetoed in time by one of their own headmen. The commonest
charm against evil spirits is a kind of wild mint called <i lang="njh">rarakham</i> (<i lang="la">Ocimum basilicum</i>).<a class="noteRef" id="n169.2src" href="#n169.2">53</a> At all “gennas,” or when going to a place supposed to be haunted by evil spirits,
a Lhota wears a sprig in the lobe of his ear and rubs some in his hair. A small onion
(<i lang="njh">sandhra</i>) or a cowrie carried on the person is also considered to be effective.
</p>
<p>Apparently the only charm used to make crops grow is a piece of rhinoceros (<i lang="njh">molung</i>) bone hidden near the field.<a class="noteRef" id="n169.3src" href="#n169.3">54</a> It must be many, many years since any Lhota has killed one of these animals, but
I am assured that pieces of bone are still carefully treasured, though they are never
shown to strangers.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Ghosts.</span> Ghost stories abound. The following one, which was told me by a man from Rephyim,
is typical: “One day I <span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>was coming up from the fields with others when I saw my elder brother’s wife coming
down to meet us. We called out to her, but she did not answer, only coughed and spat
and turned aside into the jungle. When I got up to the village I found she had died
in her husband’s house while we were down at the fields.” Another one, also from Rephyim,
runs as follows: “When my brother and I were children we met our uncle on our way
up from the fields, but when he got near us he disappeared up into the sky and threw
down a big stick and a stone. The stick just missed us, but the stone fell into my
brother’s basket.” A very common story is that of hearing someone cutting jungle near
the path, and on going there finding nothing. It is very unlucky to be touched by
a ghost (<i lang="njh">omon</i>). A man called Mhomo is said to have been caught by the leg by a ghost and died as
a result. If the sound of cutting is heard from a bamboo clump, and it is found that
there is no one there, the owner of the bamboos will die in the course of the year.
To hear at night the sound of someone stamping down the earth on a grave means that
there will be a death in the village shortly. The only ghostly animal I have heard
of is a serow said to exist near Okotso. One man’s gun is said to have missed fire
ten times while the animal stood and looked at him, while another man threw his spear
clean through it, and instead of killing the serow was ill himself for a year.<a class="noteRef" id="n170.1src" href="#n170.1">55</a>
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Dreams.</span> Like all primitive people the Lhota attaches great importance to dreams.<a class="noteRef" id="n170.2src" href="#n170.2">56</a> In them he believes that the souls of the dead visit him, and his own soul leaves
his body and <span class="pageNum" id="pb171">[<a href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>wanders.<a class="noteRef" id="n171.1src" href="#n171.1">57</a> Thus, if a sick man in his delirium dreams that he is in a certain place he knows
that his soul is under the influence of some evil spirit which is drawing it to that
place, and takes steps to appease the fiend with sacrifice. Or if a man fights with
another man in his dreams he believes that the two souls really meet and fight. To
dream of the building of a new “morung” forebodes ill to the village, for the dreamer’s
soul has travelled to the land of the dead and seen a new village being prepared there
for those who are about to die. If a man dreams that he is carrying a child along
the Road of the Dead the child will die, and the dreamer may die too. But to dream
that he is driven back by dead men means that he will have long life, for the souls
of those gone before are not yet ready to receive him.<a class="noteRef" id="n171.2src" href="#n171.2">58</a> If in his dream a man go to another village he will not live long, for the other
village is really that in the Land of the Dead, to which his soul has gone on ahead.
Similarly, to kill a chicken in a dream is bad, for the chicken seen is the soul of
that which will be killed at the dreamer’s death not long after. It is most unlucky
to dream of dead men, for it means that they have come to call the dreamer. The only
way of averting the disaster is to kill a big boar and give the meat to an old professional
dreamer (<i lang="njh">hahang</i>), who offers it to the souls of the dead in his dreams. The night before hunting
too it is most unlucky to dream of a successful hunt, for it means that the dreamer’s
spirit has been out hunting and driven all the game away.<a class="noteRef" id="n171.3src" href="#n171.3">59</a>
</p>
<p>Many dreams are regarded as symbolical. For example, dream water = real crops, so
that a vision of a deep pool means a good harvest, but a dry nullah means a lean year.
Similarly, dream jungle roots = real meat, so that to dream of digging and finding
many roots means that large presents of meat will be received, but unsuccessful digging
means <span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>small presents. Again, dream fire = real children. A fire which burns up well when
the dreamer lights it means a big family, but a fire that goes out foretells deaths
in the home. To see an earthquake or one’s own teeth falling out is regarded as particularly
unlucky and forebodes the certain death either of the dreamer or of one of his family.
Anything red, such as a red spear or red goat’s-hair, represents man’s blood and means
that someone will get hurt.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">View of the Forces of Nature.</span> The earth is regarded as flat and stretching to an unknown distance in all directions.
In the west, where the sky meets it, lives a big snake which sometimes causes earthquakes
by moving its body.<a class="noteRef" id="n172.1src" href="#n172.1">60</a> During an earthquake the meat rack over the fire and the vat in which the daily supply
of rice is kept are seized and held by the inmates of a Lhota house. If this is not
done it is believed that supplies will fail the next year.<a class="noteRef" id="n172.2src" href="#n172.2">61</a> The sky is regarded as being hard like a stone, and forming the floor of the world
of the <i>Potsos</i>, who in turn have another sky and <i lang="njh">Potso</i> world above them, and so on for an unknown number of worlds. It used to be nearer
to the earth than it is now, but for some reason not known it has gradually got further
and further away. The sun is a flaming plate of hard metal as big as a piece of ground
on which one basket of seed rice is sown. It travels along its path in the sky during
the day and at night travels back under the earth and lights the Land of the Dead.
The moon is like it. In fact, it was once the brighter and hotter of the two, till
the present sun, seeing that the earth was being scorched and burnt with the terrible
heat, smeared the face of the moon with cow-dung, so that it now gives a very feeble
light.<a class="noteRef" id="n172.3src" href="#n172.3">62</a> An eclipse of the sun or moon occurs <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>when a giant dog which lives in the sky tries to eat them.<a class="noteRef" id="n173.1src" href="#n173.1">63</a> An eclipse means that many great men will die, and the day after one is kept as an
<i lang="njh">emung</i>. Stars are little points of fire, and are vaguely regarded as being endowed with
life. Shooting stars are the falling dung of stars. The clouds have nothing to do
with rain, which is poured down by the <i>Potsos</i> from reservoirs in the sky. They are simply the accumulated smoke of thousands of
fires all over the earth. The belief with regard to hail is a curious one. The <i>Potsos</i> who live in the sky have above them yet another world of <i>Potsos</i>, who are evil and try to injure the <i>Potsos</i> living nearest to us by throwing down huge lumps of ice on them. But whenever a fusillade
begins the lower <i>Potsos</i> take care to walk about with the door of their houses held over their backs like
rain-shields. The lumps of ice are shattered on the doors and only reach the earth
as small fragments which men call hail.

teach them to the younger generation, having themselves learnt them from their forefathers.
Every tale is supposed to be told word for word as it has been handed down, but versions
naturally vary from village to village. To a tale which most of them must know by
heart the audience listens as if none of them had ever heard it before, greeting every
joke with laughter and appreciating every point. A very popular class of story is
that which explains the peculiarities of various animals. Some of these stories closely
resemble those current among the Semas and other tribes. The following are typical
examples.

<p class="first">This is a tale of the old days before deer and other animals became so different one
from the other. The sambhur and the hanuman monkey became sworn friends. In those
days the sambhur had a long tail, while the hanuman monkey had no tail at all. One
day the hanuman monkey asked the sambhur for his tail and said, “Friend, I want to
put on your tail and see how it becomes me. Please lend it to me.” Then the sambhur
said, “Put on my tail, friend, and see how it becomes you,” and gave him his tail.
But the hanuman monkey, as soon as he had put on the sambhur’s tail, climbed away
up into a tree. Then the sambhur said, “Come down, friend, and give me back my tail,”
but the hanuman monkey would not. Then the sambhur, wondering how he should make himself
a tail, pulled out his own liver and made a tail of it and put it on. Men say that
that is why even nowadays sambhur tail is so good and tastes like liver to eat.

<p class="first">The wild boar and the tiger were sworn friends. One day when they met in the jungle
the wild boar said to the tiger, “My friend, let us two fight and see which will get
the better of the other and which will fear the other. What will you take to protect
yourself?” Then the tiger said to the boar, “I will take cane and wind it round my
body,” but the boar said, “I shall smear clay all over myself.” They arranged that
the fight should take place six days later. Then the boar for six days did nothing
but smear clay over himself, letting it dry after each coating, and the tiger did
nothing but cut lengths of cane and wind them round his body. Then when the six days
were up they fell to and fought. Now whenever the tiger flew at the wild <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>boar and bit him, all he got was a mouthful of clay, but the boar, whenever he attacked
and bit the tiger, bit through a piece of cane, till he had bitten them all through
one by one and killed the tiger. But when the boar was going away after his victory
a thin piece of bamboo ran into him. Then he said, “I have killed the tiger. What
is this doing running into me?” and seized it in his mouth. But the thin bamboo cut
his tongue off so that he died on the spot.<a class="noteRef" id="n176.1src" href="#n176.1">3</a> Then another tiger came along and saw the body and ate it. That is why nowadays tigers
eat wild boars. Yet it is said that because the tiger could not beat the wild boar
at first, a tiger cannot catch one now unless he bides his time and stalks it for
two or three months.

getting in and out of scrapes, and as tricking his fellow-villagers or his friend
the tiger, usually in the meanest possible way. The name of his village is never mentioned
and there is no tradition as to where he lived. The following are typical stories
of his exploits.

<h3 class="main"><i>Apfuho and the Old Woman.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day an old woman set her rice on the fire to boil and went into her outer room
to pound oil seed. Apfuho came along carrying another man’s dog which he had killed,
and called out to the old woman, “Your rice is boiling over.” When the old woman went
back into the inner room to look at her rice, Apfuho put the dog which he was carrying
on her pounding table and called out, “A dog is eating your oil seed, old woman.”
Then the old woman came running out to see, and hit the dead dog which Apfuho had
put on the pounding table. At this Apfuho cried out, “Oh dear, oh dear, you have killed
another man’s dog. If you do not give me your pig I will tell the owner.” So the old
woman said, “I will give you my pig. Do not tell the owner.” At dusk when Apfuho came
to fetch the pig he fixed lighted torches all along the path, and said to the old
woman, “Give me your pig. Look how many men are coming with the owner of the dog,
carrying lighted torches in their hands.” To this the old woman replied, “I will give
you my pig. Go and tell them not to come.” So he went and put out the torches and
threw them away, and came back and took the pig. But as he was taking the pig away
he murmured, “What a fool of an old woman.” Her daughter heard this and said, “He
called you an old fool, mother.” But Apfuho heard her say this and replied. “I only
said ‘oo,’ girl,”<a class="noteRef" id="n177.1src" href="#n177.1">7</a> and the mother said, “Yes, yes, Apfuho only said ‘oo’.” So Apfuho went off with the
pig.<a class="noteRef" id="n177.2src" href="#n177.2">8</a>

<h3 class="main"><i>Apfuho and the Tiger.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is a tale of the olden days when men could understand the talk of animals. Apfuho
and the tiger went across a river to hollow out vats from a log on the other side.
When they had finished their vats and the time came to return, the <span class="pageNum" id="pb178">[<a href="#pb178">178</a>]</span>tiger asked Apfuho the best way to carry his vat across the river. Apfuho told him
to carry it rim upwards,<a class="noteRef" id="n178.1src" href="#n178.1">9</a> and the tiger did as Apfuho told him. But Apfuho carried his own vat upside down
and was able to cross the river, while the tiger, try as he would, could not cross
the river with his vat rim upwards. Apfuho called out, “I will pull you out,” but
instead of doing so he threw stones into the tiger’s vat and pushed him away from
land with a forked stick so that he was washed right downstream. Then Apfuho went
along to see if the tiger was drowned or not, and found him lower down by the water’s
edge. When the tiger saw Apfuho he cried, “Here is my enemy,” and tried to devour
him. But Apfuho espied a hornets’ nest by the water and said, “The men of the ‘morung’
have set me to watch the ‘morung’ drum, father tiger, and see that no stranger beats
it.” Then the tiger said, “May I beat it and see what it is like?” and Apfuho replied,
“I will ask the men of the ‘morung.’ You stay here, and if they say you may beat it,
I will shout and tell you.” So he went a long way off and shouted back, “They say
you may beat it.” Then when the tiger hit the hornets’ nest all the hornets attacked
and stung him,<a class="noteRef" id="n178.2src" href="#n178.2">10</a> and he ran and ran until he fell down a cliff and was killed.

<h3 class="main"><i>How the Villagers tried in vain to put an end to Apfuho.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The villagers, meaning to put an end to Apfuho, took him with them down to a big pond.
Then when they got to <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>the water they all began swinging out over the pool on a creeper swing. They made
Apfuho use the swing last and went away and left him, thinking he would fall off into
the middle of the pond and be drowned. Apfuho kept swinging and swinging and could
hardly hold on any longer, when he espied a man and a woman wearing fine ornaments
and leading a mithan by a rope. He saw that they were an eloping couple and called
out to them, “Who are you? There is a beautiful breeze here which makes swinging very
pleasant. Take off your ornaments and put them on the ground and tie up the mithan.
Then pull me in with a hooked stick and come and have a swing yourselves.” So they
did as Apfuho told them, and took their ornaments off and put them down and pulled
Apfuho in with a forked stick, and both began to swing.
</p>
<p>But when they asked Apfuho to pull them in, instead of doing so he let them fall into
the water and drown. Then Apfuho put on their ornaments and took their mithan and
went up to the village. And the villagers were astonished and said, “Where have you
come from with those ornaments and that mithan, Apfuho?” And he said to them, “In
the middle of the pond there are many ornaments and many mithan too. I only brought
away these. If you too want to get some you should go and dive into the pond.” Then
all the villagers said to him in chorus, “Take me, Apfuho; take me, Apfuho.” So a
few days later Apfuho led the villagers in a body down to the water. There he picked
them up one by one and threw them in. Of the men who sank quietly he said, “The ornaments
and mithan <i>he</i> gets won’t be very good.” But when people struggled hard, with the water pouring
from their mouth and nose, he said, “The ornaments and mithan <i>he</i> gets will be splendid.” So he let all the people of the village whom he had thrown
into the water drown.<a class="noteRef" id="n179.1src" href="#n179.1">11</a>
</p>
<p>Now a blind old woman was stumbling along, feeling her way by the water’s edge. Apfuho
put an old worn dao in front of her, and when she found it as she groped she said,
“Well, if a person like me can find this, people with no infirmities will get a lot.”
Then Apfuho went up to her and <span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>said, “Now, old woman, you go in too. What are you doing on the edge?” and with these
words he caught her and threw her into the middle of the pond so that she was drowned.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The audience always appreciates a play upon words such as occurs in the story of Apfuho
and the Old Woman. All Nagas love a pun. A good one is immortal. Ao women—a most pugnacious
section of the human race—pun on the names of their adversaries most elaborately.
In some Lhota stories practically the whole point depends on a pun. The following
is an example.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long, long ago, before the Great Darkness came, there lived a man who kept wild dogs,
as men now call them. With his dogs he killed and ate many deer. But at last he got
so old that he could no longer go into the jungle with his dogs. So he called them
all to him and brought them to his house. There he cooked enough rice for each to
have a share, but when he divided it up it did not go round properly and the youngest
dog got none. Then the old man said, “My dogs, I am very old and can no longer go
out hunting with you. But do not forget how I looked after you and cared for you.
When you kill a deer, always leave a leg (<i lang="njh">ocho</i>) for me at the cross-roads.” When the dogs had gone away they quite forgot what the
old man had said to them. Now the youngest dog was angry with the old man because
he had given him no rice. So when the other dogs asked him what the old man had said
he replied, “The old man said, ‘Whenever you kill a deer, leave dung (<i lang="njh">ochü</i>) for me at the cross-roads.<span class="corr" id="xd31e8552" title="Not in source">’</span>” That is why to this day wild dogs leave their droppings at the cross-roads.<a class="noteRef" id="n180.1src" href="#n180.1">12</a>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were once two brothers. The elder was poor, but the younger was very rich. The
younger brother ignored the elder and kept all his care and affection for his friend.
One day the younger brother said to his friend, “My friend, to-day we will go and
pick and eat red berries.” So saying they went. The younger brother climbed the tree,
and while he was picking and eating the berries smeared himself all over with the
red juice. Then he called out, “Friend, friend, I am falling,” and tumbled out of
the tree. His friend climbed down and looked at him as he lay on the ground and said,
“You are no relation of mine. I shall not look after you. I will go and tell your
brother and get him to come.” With these words he went away without attending to him
at all. But his brother came and saw him, and looking at him said, “My brother, forgetful
one, when you were alive you scorned and neglected me and kept all your love and affection
for your friends.” With these words he picked him up to carry him, but the younger
brother said, “Brother, there is nothing the matter with me,” and got up and himself
carried his elder brother home. Thereafter the friends were friends no more, but the
two brothers loved one another. That is why men say that there is nothing in life
equal to the love of one’s own relations.

<p>Stories of the Water Spirit (<i lang="njh">Tchhüpfu</i>) are common, and usually describe a visit paid by someone to his lair in a deep pool,
as in the following.

<h3 class="main"><i>The Boy and the Water Spirit.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day a boy went down to the Doyang to fish. When he did not return home in the
evening his parents became very anxious, and in the morning his father took some men
down to search for him; but he was nowhere to be found. Then his father was sad at
heart and went wandering alone along the Doyang, determined to find at least the dead
body of his son. As he went he saw a hair on the ground, and picked it up, thinking
it belonged to his son. But it was so long that he only picked up one end of it, and
walked on winding it round and round his finger. He went on and on until he had passed
eight bends of the river, so long was the hair. At last he came to a Water Spirit,
for the hair was one of the Water Spirit’s which he had forgotten to wind round his
head. Then the Water Spirit cried out, “Let me go,” but the man replied, “You have
seized my son and taken him to your home in the water. I will not let you go till
you bring him out and give him back to me.” Then the Water Spirit said, “Let me go
and I will bring your son and leave him here. If you do not believe me you may make
me swear the most solemn oath known to men.” At this <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>the man let him go, and the Spirit gave him a gift of friendship, dried fish and fresh
fish and fish paste, and said, “In the morning I will bring your son out of the water
and leave him here. Come at the time when men go to their fields and you will find
him.”
</p>
<p>Obedient to the words of the Spirit the man came in the morning at the time when men
go to their fields, and there sure enough was his son on the bank. The tale he told
his father was this: “I saw a big fish in the water, and dived in and caught hold
of it. It dragged me into a hole under the rocks in the pool, where there was no water.
There on the dry sand was a hearth made of three human skulls. It was the lair of
the Water Spirit.” The Water Spirit had not hurt the boy, but had brought him out
and left him on the bank, as he had promised to his father. So the father found his
son safe by the side of the water and they both went back home. The tale is remembered
to this day.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Otherwise tales of supernatural beings are comparatively rare. The story of Sityingo
and Ngazo, two jungle godlings, will serve as a sample.

said to Sityingo, “I have only caught this and you have caught so many,” and showed
him the rat. Then Sityingo replied, “Even that you only got because I gave it to you.”
To which Ngazo replied, “What, I have dug out this rat after digging all day and you
say you gave it me!” “Then let it go,” said Sityingo, “and see whether I gave it you
or not.” So Ngazo let it go as Sityingo said, but the rat burrowed into the ground,
and Ngazo, though he dug and dug after it, could not catch it again. Then said Sityingo,
“You say I did not give it you and yet you cannot dig it out!” At these words <span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>Ngazo became angry and they fell to wrestling, and Ngazo twisted Sityingo’s neck.
That is why Sityingo can only look one way. Men say to this day that a hunter towards
whom Sityingo looks is sure to get something, but that he from whom Sityingo’s face
is turned away will get nothing at all.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man took a company of children down to his fields to work. When they had worked
all morning and it was time for the midday meal they asked him to give them their
rice. But the owner of the field and his family said it was not yet time and would
not give them any rice. Then the children said they were going to bathe and all went
off, and said, “They would not give us our rice in time, so we will become catfish.”
With these words they turned into catfish, calling out, “We are catfish, we are catfish.”
The owner of the field called out, “Come along, I will give you your rice,” but the
children replied, “You would not give it us before. Now we have forgotten about men’s
food. We will not come,” and swam away in the form of catfish. It is because these
children were wearing dao-holders when they were turned into fish that catfish always
have a mark on them like a dao-holder—so men say.

them fall. Then, determined not to <span class="pageNum" id="pb185">[<a href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>let the leaves fall, they tied them onto the twigs and set to work to drag the tree
again. In spite of this all the leaves fell off. Then they were ashamed to go back

became mynas and called “<i lang="njh">Kyon, kyon</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="n185.1src" href="#n185.1">17</a> But the women ground up rice flour to make rice beer and smeared it on their foreheads

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day a man of the Kikung clan named Yanzo took his nine dogs with him and went
to hunt deer. But they would do nothing but jump and give tongue round a tree with
a hole in it. Then Yanzo, knowing that his dogs would not give tongue for nothing,
cut down the tree to see what was inside it, and found in it a jungle man. This man
he took home and brought up and called Kithamo. Kithamo had a son called Mering, for
whom Yanzo arranged a wife called <span class="pageNum" id="pb186">[<a href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>Khamdrio. Now Khamdrio had wonderful long hair—once and a half as long as a man could
span with outstretched arms. One day when she was washing her head at the river one
of her hairs fell in and was swallowed by a little fish, which went down the stream
and was caught by an Assamese. The fisherman was amazed when he split open the fish
and saw the hair, and took and showed it to the king. Then the king gave orders that
the woman to whom the hair belonged was to be brought to him,<a class="noteRef" id="n186.1src" href="#n186.1">20</a> and sent one of his councillors with his soldiers to Mering’s village. But Mering
had fenced his village with a hedge of stinging leaves,<a class="noteRef" id="n186.2src" href="#n186.2">21</a> which the king’s soldiers could not penetrate. Then the councillor ordered his soldiers
to pick one of the leaves and take it back with them. And he came to the king and
said, “The village is fenced with a hedge of this, so that we could by no means force
it.” And the king took and put the leaf on his stomach under his clothes to see how
it would sting, and he understood how terrible the pain was. Then he sent the councillor
to inquire of Mering whether there was anything of which he was afraid. And Mering
made answer, “There is nothing in the whole world of which I am afraid. You can only
make me afraid by sending up to my village nine elephants with cotton piled on their
backs. That will make me afraid.” So the king sent up nine elephants to break down
the nine hedges of stinging leaves. Then Mering heated his spear red hot, and waiting
till the elephants had reached the fence, threw it at the first one. The cotton on
its back caught alight, and when the flames reached its body it ran in among the other
elephants and set them alight one after the other. Then the elephants fled and trampled
many of the men to death. Then the king announced that he would cease to fight with
Mering and would trade with him instead. And he called <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>an Assamese and said to him, “Take a pot of cornelian beads with you and go up to
Mering’s village. If anyone wishes to buy from you, do not sell, but go on hawking
your wares right through the village, and as you go scatter beads in the hedge of
stinging leaves. Having done this come down to me again.” And he went and did as he
was bade, and the men of Mering’s village cut down and destroyed all their hedge in
their search for the beads which had been scattered there. Then the king sent men
into the hills with dogs to hunt down Mering, and Mering fled to Yanzo’s village to
take refuge with him. It so happened that Yanzo was building his house. He therefore
made Mering hide under a heap of thatching grass which was lying ready to hand, and
then went and eased himself on the top of the pile. When the Assamese came up with
their dogs they began to toss the thatching grass to this side and that in their search
for Mering. Then Yanzo said to them, “Your dogs are very clever. Perhaps they are
looking for this filth here.” At these words all the Assamese were filled with shame
and whipped off their dogs and departed.<a class="noteRef" id="n187.1src" href="#n187.1">22</a> Because of this Mering and Yanzo broke an iron staff and swore<a class="noteRef" id="n187.2src" href="#n187.2">23</a> on it that they would become one clan and would never intermarry. Afterwards a son
was born to Mering whose name was Rapvu. He lived at Nungkamchung, where a bastard
son was born to him of a woman of the Kikung clan. This son’s name was Lobemo and
his descendants still live at Tsingaki. But the legitimate children of Rapvu are the
ancestors of the Kithang clan.

them, and wounded one <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>with his spear. This he tracked and tracked till he came to the house of Lichao, the
old man guardian of wild pigs. There he found two maidens feeding the pig he had wounded.
They asked him what he had come for, but he was afraid to tell the truth and say that
he was tracking a wild pig that he had wounded, so he replied, “Hearing that there
were two beautiful maidens at your house I came to see, hoping that I might take one
as my wife.” Then they told him to come another day, so he departed.
</p>
<p>When the man came a little later Lichao made his slave-girl put on beautiful ornaments
and fine clothes, but his real daughter he made to sit all in rags and dirty in the
outside room. But the man was not to be deceived. He loved Lichao’s daughter and would
only take her.<a class="noteRef" id="n188.1src" href="#n188.1">24</a> Now Lichao used to turn into a tiger and eat human flesh. Therefore he set his son-in-law
hard tasks, meaning to devour him if he did not fulfil them. But when she knew this
the maiden said to him, “Whatever task my father gives you to perform, tell me and
I will reveal to you his purpose.” So one day Lichao said to the man, “Go and pick
the leaves of <i lang="njh">kotyoh</i> thorns and <i lang="njh">koremyoi</i> thorns, and bring them without a single leaf being torn and without a single scratch
on your body. If you do this I will let you depart with my daughter.” Then the girl
said to her husband,<a class="noteRef" id="n188.2src" href="#n188.2">25</a> “If you come home with the slightest scratch on your body, or with a single leaf
torn, my father will devour you.” So her husband went and picked the leaves without
a single one being torn and without scratching his body in the least, and rolled them
into a very tight bundle and brought and gave them to Lichao. Then Lichao said, “Only
that amount will not be enough for us,” but when he opened the <span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span>bundle to look, the leaves covered all the ground in front of his house.
</p>
<p>A few days later Lichao said, “If you can catch and tie up one of my pigs alone I
will let you take my daughter and go,” and with these words gave him a length of unsplit
cane. Then the man fell to thinking how he could catch one of the pigs, for they were
wild pigs; and his wife said to him, “If you cannot catch a pig my father will devour
you.” At last he caught a pig, and his wife beat the cane on the ground to fray it
and gave it to him. Thus holding the pig with one hand he pulled off strips of cane
with the other and bound the pig fast. Then Lichao let him take his daughter and go.
</p>
<p>So the girl came to her husband’s house. But there she could get no human flesh to
eat, and soon became so weak and thin that she could not work. One day her husband
said to her, “Why are you so weak and thin?” To which his wife replied, “I am thin
and weak because I cannot get the food which my parents used to give me.” Then when
her husband asked what her parents used to give her to eat she replied, “I will send
you to fetch a parcel of meat wrapped in leaves from my parents’ house. But bring
it straight here. Do not open it and look to see what is inside.” So he went, and
his wife’s parents gave him some pieces of human flesh wrapped up in leaves. This
he brought straight home to his wife without opening the leaves to look to see what
was inside, and when she ate it it made her as plump and strong as ever. But in a
day or two, because she could get no more human flesh to eat, she again became so
thin and weak that she could not work. Then she spoke to her husband again and told
him to go and fetch some more meat from her parents’ house. Now her husband was determined
to open the bundle and see what kind of meat it was that made his wife get well again
when she was so thin and weak that she could not work. But Lichao sent a little bird
to go back with him so that he should not open the parcel of human flesh on the way.
When the man fingered the parcel which Lichao had given him, having it in his heart
to open it, the little bird said to him, “If you <span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>open it I shall tell my father; if you open it I shall tell my father.” So he did
not open it and look inside. But when he had given the parcel of meat to his wife
he went and hid and watched quietly to see what kind of meat her father had given
him to bring. Now it was nothing but human fingers tied up in leaves that her father
had given him to bring. And his wife undid the leaves and roasted the fingers lightly
in the fire and ate them one after another. Now when he saw this her husband was much
troubled and said, “What meat have your parents sent you? What meat is that you are
eating?” But she said, “Nay, I will not tell you. You will only be troubled at heart
and filled with fear.” But he said, “I shall not be afraid. Tell me.” Then his wife
said, “I shall turn into a tiger. When I go about the house showing my fangs and roaring
you must slip a basket over me. If you cannot slip a basket over me I shall devour
even you.” With these words she turned into a tiger, and her husband tried to cover
her with a basket but could not, so she caught and ate him. That is the end of the
story.

<h3 class="main"><i>The Girl who Married a Tiger.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A woman one day went down to her field to fetch some vegetables. She saw a fine gourd
there and was just going to pick it, when a tiger saw her and said, “That is my gourd.
Why were you going to pick it? I shall kill you.” With these words he caught her,
but the woman, who was about to become a mother, said, “Do not kill me, and I will
give you my baby when it is born,” so the tiger let her go. In due time a daughter
was born to the woman. When the tiger heard of this he kept asking the woman if her
child was born yet, till at last she told the tiger that it had been born. Soon the
tiger asked her if her daughter was strong enough to fetch firewood and water yet,
and whether she was old enough to be married. But the woman kept putting him off by
saying that her daughter was not yet old enough to carry wood and water and was too
young to marry; till at last she saw that she must keep the bargain <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>she had made, and told the tiger that the girl was old enough to work as his wife.
But as she sat weaving a cloth for her daughter to wear on her wedding-day she was
overcome with grief when she thought how her child would surely be killed and eaten
by the tiger, and her tears fell fast on the cloth she was making. Her husband, too,
was sad as he worked at a basket he was making for his daughter to carry when she
went to her husband’s house, and his tears fell fast on the basket. When the girl
saw this she said, “Why are you crying, mother?” and her mother answered, “I poked
myself in the eye with my bobbin.” To her father, too, the girl said, “Why are you
crying, father?” And her father replied, “I poked myself in the eye with a slip of
bamboo.” Then when the day came her parents gave her in marriage to the tiger.
</p>
<p>About a year later a little daughter was born to the tiger and his wife. When her
mother carried her she never cried, but when her father carried her she cried all
the time. So the woman said to the tiger, “Why do you make our daughter cry so much?”
The tiger replied, “It is because my beard pricks her.” But one day the woman hid
herself and watched, and saw the tiger knock his little daughter’s head “tap, tap”
against a hearthstone and lick up the blood which dripped down. When she saw this
the woman resolved to run away from the tiger, and said to him, “I am going to fetch
some wood. Hold the baby till I come back.” But the tiger said, “I am coming too.”
And whenever she asked him to look after the baby while she went to get water, or
went to the fields or into the jungle, the tiger always replied, “I am coming too,”
and never let her out of his sight. At last one day she asked him to look after the
child while she went down to the spring to wash its carrying cloth.<a class="noteRef" id="n191.1src" href="#n191.1">26</a> So he took the child and she went down to the spring and set a louse and a flea to
wash the cloth, “chuck-chuck, chuck-chuck,” while she ran off and made for her parents’
house. The tiger, thinking the noise made by the <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>louse and the flea was his wife washing the cloth, kept calling out, “The baby is
crying. Come up and nurse it.” But when she did not come up he went down to look for
himself, and found his wife gone and the louse and the flea there instead. Then he
said, “You would play tricks on me, would you?” and crushed the louse with his thumb-nail,
but the flea jumped and got away.
</p>
<p>Then the tiger set out to search for his wife and asked everyone he met whether they
had seen her pass. All replied that they had not seen her, till at last he came to
the <i lang="njh">sangalia</i> creeper, who said she had just gone by that way. Then he chased and chased her till
he came up with her at dusk at the door of her parents’ house. The woman cried out,
“Mother, come out of the inner room and open the door for me.” But her mother replied,
“Who is that? I have no daughter. My daughter disappeared long ago,” and would not
come out and open the door. Then the woman said again, “I am your own daughter, mother,
whom years ago, when I was little, you hit on the head with the pigs’ food ladle.
Do you not know me now?” With these words she began to squeeze through the little
opening by the door left for the dogs, but the tiger seized her legs while her mother
seized her head and shoulders. And they pulled and pulled till she was torn in two
and the tiger was left with her lower half and her mother with the upper half. Then
the tiger took his half to his house and kept watch over it with a whisk so that not
a single fly should settle on it, and buried it. And he wept, saying, “O my wife,
when you were alive I loved you so much that I was careful always to give you good
meat to eat as relish with your rice. You never had to eat leaves and such-like poor
fare.” But her mother said, “Why do you weep so? We have torn her in half. Now we
will cook and eat her.” And she cooked a little of the flesh from the upper half of
the girl and offered it to the tiger, who refused it, saying, “How can I eat the flesh
of the mother of my daughter?” But at last he ate it. Then he said, “Human flesh is
good,” and went and dug up the portion he had buried and ate that too. That is how
the tiger came to eat human flesh, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>that is why to this day tigers sometimes kill and devour men.
</p>
<p>The ordinary Lhota believes the founders of the tribe came out of the earth, and does
not worry his head as to how they originated in the world below. The following story,
however, is an example of the widely spread myth that the world was populated by the
offspring of a brother and sister.<a class="noteRef" id="n193.1src" href="#n193.1">27</a>

<h3 class="main"><i>Lankongrhoni and the Villagers.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the days of our ancestors there lived a woman called Lankongrhoni. She had a son
who was very handsome. His name was Arilao. All the girls admired him only and wished
to marry him. They cared nothing for the other men. So all the men of the village
planned to kill him treacherously. They agreed that on any day when they should all
go down to the river to poison fish, whoever failed to come was to be fined a big
pig. Two or three days later they went down. Then Arilao’s mother said to him, “Son,
do not go.” But he said, “Do you want us to lose our big pig, mother?” and went. And
the men felled a tree on the river bank and hewed a trough out of it and said, “Let
every man lie in the trough in turn and see if he looks a fine man.” So they each
lay down in turn, but as each man lay in the trough the others kept repeating, “You
don’t look nice, you don’t look nice.” At last they said, “Let Arilao lie down,” and
made him get into the trough, and calling out, “Arilao looks nice; we are pounding
up <span class="corr" id="xd31e8758" title="Source: Ariloa">Arilao</span>, we are pounding up Arilao,” they pounded him up with the fish poison. Now Arilao
had a friend, and he was very sad because Arilao had been killed that day, and waited
weeping further down stream. Soon the finger-nail of his friend Arilao came floating
down and lodged against him. Then he said, “Is this all there is left of my friend?”
and with <span class="pageNum" id="pb194">[<a href="#pb194">194</a>]</span>these words lifted the nail off the water, and wrapping it in a leaf slipped it into
his belt. The villagers made a fine haul of fish, but Arilao’s friend was so sad that
he did not trouble to catch a single one. When the villagers trooped off up towards
the village he hung back to the last.
</p>
<p>Now Lankongrhoni came to meet her son on the way and asked each of her fellow-villagers,
“Where is your companion?” or “Where is your friend?” or “Where is your younger brother?”
or “Where is your elder brother?” And each man replied, “He is coming behind, laughing
and talking with the girls. He is just coming.” At last came Arilao’s friend, weeping
and very sad. When Lankongrhoni asked him where his friend was he said, “The news
would make you sad, mother. I will not tell you.” But she replied, “Do not give way
to grief, my son. Tell me.” Then he said, “Mother, this is all that is left of my
friend,” and gave her his friend’s nail which he had carried up in his belt. Then
Lankongrhoni was very sad, but she hid her grief, and a few days later gave notice
to the village saying, “To-morrow bring all the children to my house. I am going to
kill my big pig and give them a feast there.” So the next day the villagers brought
all their children to Lankongrhoni’s house and left them there and went down to their
fields. Then Lankongrhoni killed her big pig and feasted the village children on it.
Afterwards she made the children remain shut up in her house while she went outside
and said, “Children, tell me where there are holes in my house,” and they replied,
“There is a hole here, granny,” or “There is a hole there, granny,” and she stopped
up the holes as the children told her of them. At last she called from outside and
said, “Are there any more holes, children?” And they replied, “There are no more holes,
granny.” Then she said, “I want to light my pipe now. Give me a brand.” So they gave
her a brand and she set fire to the house and burnt all the children to ashes. But
she herself climbed away up a thread thrown down from the sky and disappeared.<a class="noteRef" id="n194.1src" href="#n194.1">28</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb195">[<a href="#pb195">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now the villagers knew nothing of what had happened. But a crow went from field to
field and hopped about in front of the workers dressed in a skirt like a little girl,
and said, “Arilao’s mother has utterly destroyed the children of the village.” Then
the villagers said, “What does it mean to-day, a crow behaving like that? Surely something
has happened,” and so saying they all went off home. And when they saw that all their
children had been burnt up, each said to his neighbour, “This is your fault, this
is your fault,” and they fell upon each other and killed each other so that they all
died. But two orphans, a brother and sister, were frightened when they saw this and
climbed up into a fowl-house and hid. Afterwards, all the villagers being dead, there
were none for them to marry, so they became husband and wife, and from these two,
even from their fingers and toes, were born all the men there are in the world. This
is one of the stories which men tell.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>A few stories like the following are found which purport to give the origin of some
common saying.

<h3 class="main"><i>The Woman with a Caterpillar for a Husband.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man and his wife lived together. Now at night the husband was a man, but in the
day he turned into a hairy caterpillar. His wife did not know this. One night before
she went to sleep she said, “To-morrow I am going to gather some leaves to eat.” Early
in the morning her husband left the house first and turned into a caterpillar and
nipped off the leaves and waited at the place. Then the woman came and at the sight
of the leaves exclaimed, “Strange, a caterpillar has nipped off the leaves. I will
take them and go.” So saying she took the leaves and went. But that night when they
were in bed she said to her husband, “To-day I found that a caterpillar had nipped
off the leaves I went to gather.” Then her husband said, “It was I.” At these words
she was greatly troubled, and when he was asleep she gently pushed and pushed her
husband till he fell off the bed into the fire and was burnt. After that the <span class="pageNum" id="pb196">[<a href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>woman swallowed caterpillar hairs with her food, whenever she ate, and coughed and
coughed till she died. Therefore nowadays if anyone coughs much people say, “You should
not burn a caterpillar.”

<p>The forces of Nature form the subjects of several folk-tales, as the two following

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the beginning of time what is now the sun was the moon, and what is now the moon
was the sun. In those days when what is now the moon was the sun it was very hot,
so that all the leaves and the trees in the jungle shrivelled up and died, and men
suffered torments from the heat. Then what is now the sun said to the moon (which
was the sun in those days), “Why do you shine so fiercely that you make all the leaves
and trees in the jungle shrivel up and die, and cause men to suffer torments from
the heat? You by being the sun are making men and leaves to die from heat and the
world will be destroyed. Therefore from to-day I will not let you be the sun.” With
these words he smeared the face of what is now the moon with cow-dung, and what is
now the sun become the sun. Therefore men say that the dark marks on the moon are
where the sun smeared cow-dung on its face.<a class="noteRef" id="n196.1src" href="#n196.1">29</a>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Wagtail and the Owlet.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Long, long ago, about the time that the Great Darkness came upon the earth, all the
birds—for in those days the kinds were not as different as they are now—met in council
<span class="pageNum" id="pb197">[<a href="#pb197">197</a>]</span>to decide how night should follow day. With one voice they called on the owlet to
give his opinion. Then the owlet said, “Let there be nine days’ darkness and nine
days’ light.” “No, no,” said all the birds, and smacked him on this side of his head
and on that. That is why nowadays the owlet has a flat head. Then all the birds said,
“Who will speak now?” And the wagtail said, “Listen to me, then; I will speak. Let
us make darkness and light alternately, day by day.” “Yes, yes,” said all the birds,
and stroked the wagtail<a class="noteRef" id="n197.1src" href="#n197.1">30</a> all over. He used to be as big as a village cock, but because all the birds stroked
him so much he is now very small.

<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>Finally, there is the story of the hero Ramphan and his dao. According to one tradition
Ramphan is supposed to have lived when the Lhotas and Rengmas were still one tribe,
and some Rengmas from Themokedima once even came to Akuk and claimed the dao, which
is still preserved there as an heirloom. It is a long, thin piece of iron about two
feet long and three inches broad. The spike of the haft is long and evidently protruded
through the wooden haft, which probably existed once. It is rarely shown to strangers,
and never to Southern Lhotas, on the ground that they approach Akuk from the direction
of the Land of the Dead. The story given below is that told by the present possessors
of the dao, and places the scene of the exploit at Longcham, an abandoned site on
Wokha Hill, whence the Lhotas are supposed to have spread into the country now occupied
by them.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="xd31e8806" class="div2 section"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#toc">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><i>The Story of Ramphan.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the Lhotas were living at Longcham a tiger caused them grievous loss. One day
it killed all of a party of nine women. Among them was Ramphan’s wife, who was about
to become a mother. At this disaster all clamoured to abandon the village, but Ramphan
said he would go and face <span class="pageNum" id="pb198">[<a href="#pb198">198</a>]</span>the tiger. First he put on each of his fingers a section of thin bamboo. Then he took
his long dao and lay down among the corpses of the nine women and waited for the tiger.
Soon the tiger came and went to each corpse and ate a little of the flesh and laid
it on one side, saying as he did so, “This one I killed on her way to the fields,”
or “This one I killed when she went to cut wood,” or “This one I killed on her way
to fetch water,” or “This one I killed when she went to pick jungle leaves,” or “This
one I killed when she went to get vegetables,” or “This one I killed when she was
going down to fish.” At last he came to Ramphan and said, “This one I do not remember,”
and picked him up and laid him aside, and then settled himself down to sleep. Then
one by one Ramphan began to snap the pieces of bamboo on his fingers to see if the
tiger was asleep or not. But at each snap the tiger pricked up his ears. At last when
he had snapped nine of the pieces of bamboo and there was only one left, Ramphan thought
to himself, “If the tiger is not asleep when I snap this I am done for.” But when
he snapped the last remaining piece of bamboo the tiger did not prick up its ears,
for it was fast asleep. Then Ramphan rose up and cut off the tiger’s head with his
long dao, and climbed with it up to the top of a high spur and shouted the shout of
a warrior who has taken a head. But he was sad when he thought of his wife lying dead
in the valley below. And he called to his village men and said, “I have slain our
enemy. Do not desert your village. Wait for me.” But when he reached home he found
that the villagers had already abandoned the place. From far away they shouted back
to him, “We have sprinkled the back of one of our sows with rice husks, which fall
as she walks. Follow the track of that and come.” Now as Ramphan followed the trail
of rice husks he caught up on the path a woman who was a leper. And the woman, whose
name was Mangtsilo, said to Ramphan, “What does this mean, father? A poisonous snake
here said, ‘Snake-plant, snake-plant, Mangtsilo,’ and glided over my leg. What does
it mean?” Then Ramphan told her to crush up some leaves of the snake-plant and lay
them on her leg. And she did <span class="pageNum" id="pb199">[<a href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>as he told her and her leprosy was cured.<a class="noteRef" id="n199.1src" href="#n199.1">31</a> Then Ramphan took her as his wife.
</p>
<p>One day when Mangtsilo was weaving outside her house, Ramphan’s slaves began to spin
their tops near by. They made Mangtsilo’s brothers join in, and drew them on and on
till they came close to her house. Then one of the brothers recognized his sister
Mangtsilo, and went and told his parents that he had seen a woman exactly like his
sister. But his parents said, “Your sister was lost long ago. Her very bones have
rotted away by now. How could you have seen her?” But he said again and again that
he had seen a woman exactly like his sister, so that at last his parents went to see
and found that it was indeed Mangtsilo. Then they demanded her marriage price from
Ramphan, but Ramphan said, “First give me the marriage feast and then I will give
you the marriage price.” So her father said, “What can I do? Make and give me only
a bamboo spoon and a bamboo rice-stirrer.” So Ramphan made and gave him only a bamboo
spoon and a rice-stirrer. That is why Ramphan and Mangtsilo only had one son and one
daughter born to them.

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#n174.1src">1</a></span> Naga folk-lore in general has much in common with that of other races of Mongolian
affinities. Thus the Naga (Angami) and Kachari story of the origin of the domestication
of certain animals as opposed to the rest is akin to the Lapp story given by Mr. Andrew
Lang under the title of “The Elf Maiden,” in his <i>Brown Fairy Book</i>. The Angami story is to be found in <i>The Angami Nagas</i>, Part IV., the Terhengi Genna, and the Kachari version in Soppitt, <i>Historical and Descriptive Account of the Kachari Tribes of the North Cachar Hills</i>, p. 56. Much closer, however, is the resemblance between an incident in the story
of “The Fox and the Lapp” (same volume of Mr. Lang’s Fairy Tales), and the almost
verbally identical incident in the Sema story of Iki and the Tiger (<i>The Sema Nagas</i>, p. 319). In the latter Iki escapes from the tiger by pointing to a hornbill flying
over and saying, “I made that.” The tiger asks if Iki can make him like it, and on
Iki’s consenting agrees to let himself be tied up, and to undergo an operation entailing
his destruction. In the Lapp story the fox escapes from the bear by precisely the
same ruse, a woodpecker taking the place of the hornbill. In the same volume of Mr.
Lang’s is a story called “The Husband of the Rat’s Daughter,” quoted as from <i lang="fr">Contes Populaires</i>, but apparently coming from Japan, which is identical with the Angami story of “The
Rat Maiden” (<i>The Angami Nagas</i>, Part V.).—J.&nbsp;H. H.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#n174.1src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="first">Sir George Grierson, in his <i>Linguistic Survey of India</i>, places<a class="noteRef" id="n207.1src" href="#n207.1">1</a> the Lhota language in the central sub-group of Naga languages, together with Ao,
Tangsa,<a class="noteRef" id="n207.2src" href="#n207.2">2</a> Thukumi<a class="noteRef" id="n207.3src" href="#n207.3">3</a> and Yachumi. The Lhotas have no script of their own, though they have a tradition
that they once possessed skins with writing on them. Being hungry they ate the skins
and have been illiterate savages ever since.<a class="noteRef" id="n207.4src" href="#n207.4">4</a>
</p>
<p>The grammar of the language has been described by Dr. W.&nbsp;G. Witter of the American
Baptist Foreign Mission Society in his <i>Outline Grammar of the Lhota Naga Language</i>. I propose to confine myself, therefore, to a brief note founded on that work.
</p>
<p>There are two dialects, the Liye and Ndrung, spoken north and south of the Doyang
respectively, which differ but little save in the pronunciation of certain consonants.
For example, Liye <i lang="njh">tiing</i> (seven) becomes <i lang="njh">kiing</i> in Ndrung; similarly <i lang="njh">otyak</i> (basket) becomes <i lang="njh">okyak</i>; <i lang="njh">otyam</i> (needle) becomes <i lang="njh">opyam</i>, and so on.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="marginnote">Article.</span> For the indefinite article <i lang="njh">mătsanga</i> is used both with persons and things, and <i lang="njh">nchyua</i> with persons only. The article is, however, usually omitted unless there is some
special emphasis on the singleness of the person or thing spoken of. The place of
the definite article is taken by demonstrative pronouns.
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Gender.</span> There is no distinction of gender except in the case of animate objects. For human
beings <i lang="njh">epue</i>, “male,” and <i lang="njh">elue</i>, “female,” are added when the sex is not otherwise indicated; e.g. <i lang="njh">ngāro</i>, “infant,” <i lang="njh">ngaro epue</i>, “little boy,” <i lang="njh">ngaro elue</i>, “little girl.” In the case of animals, <i lang="njh">ōpong</i>, “male,” and <i lang="njh">ōkhu</i>, “female,” are used; e.g. <i lang="njh">wōkō</i>, “pig,” <i lang="njh">wokopong</i>, “boar,” <i lang="njh">wokokhu</i>, “sow.”
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Number.</span> The plural termination is “<i lang="njh">ang</i>,” affixed to the demonstrative pronoun <i lang="njh">chi</i> or <i lang="njh">shi</i>. “The men have gone”: “<i lang="njh">Kyonchiang yichaka</i>.” The word “<i lang="njh">ōni</i>” is used as a form of dual. “We two,” <i lang="njh">eni</i> (i.e. <i lang="njh">e-oni</i>). “My father and your brother came yesterday”: “<i lang="njh">Āpo nā nīta oni nchü roa</i>.”
</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">Case.</span> The subject of a transitive verb takes the suffix <i lang="njh">nā</i>, which is also that of the instrument. In the case of two or more subjects the suffix
is attached to the one nearest <span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>the verb. When the subject is followed by an adjective qualifying it, the suffix is
attached to the adjective.

<span class="intra"><span lang="njh" class="top">pia.</span> <span lang="en" class="bottom">give.</span></span>

<span class="intra"><span lang="njh" class="top">săpo-lo.</span> <span lang="en" class="bottom">tall-on.</span></span>
</p>

<span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>To form the comparative an adjective takes the suffix “<i lang="njh">wo</i>” or sometimes for euphony “<i lang="njh">mo</i>.”

<span class="intra"><span lang="njh" class="top">sapowo.</span> <span lang="en" class="bottom">(is) taller.</span></span>
</p>
<p>In interrogative sentences the adjective plus the comparative suffix <i lang="njh">wo</i> is repeated first with the interrogative suffix <i lang="njh">alo</i>, and then with the interrogative suffix <i lang="njh">ela</i>.

(<i>i.e.</i> Which is taller, Yanasao or Asao?)
</p>
<p>The superlative is formed by adding the suffix “<i lang="njh">wo</i>” to the adjective as in the comparative, and putting some word meaning “all” before
the noun representing the things among which comparison is being made.

It is a common sight to see, say, five little bits of bamboo stuck up in a prominent

termination <i lang="njh">-a</i>. These modifiers are followed by the suffixes already mentioned. The commonest are
as follow:—

<p>Possessive nouns and pronouns precede the thing possessed, but adjectives follow the
noun they qualify.

<p>In compound sentences the principal clause stands last.

</p>
<p>In reporting the words of a third person the actual words spoken are placed with the
particle <i lang="njh">to</i> immediately in front of the principal verb.
</p>
<p>Thus “Chongsemo said he would go” would be in Lhota—

<p>If the actual words of the speaker are not used the indirect discourse is placed after
the principal clause and its verb takes the affix <i lang="njh">-lato</i>.

<p>Translated into ordinary English the story runs as follows:—
</p>
<p>The cuckoo and the crow became sworn friends. One day the cuckoo said to the crow,
“My friend, you ornament me prettily with this gum and I will do the same to you,”
and got the crow to do as he was asked. The crow <span class="pageNum" id="pb222">[<a href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>then made the same request to the cuckoo and gave him the gum. But the cuckoo cried,
“My mother is calling me, my mother is calling me,” and poured the gum all over the
crow’s head and ran away. That is why the crow is black and the cuckoo is so frightened
of the crow that he only wanders about at night, calling, “Cuckoo, cuckoo.”<a class="noteRef" id="n222.1src" href="#n222.1">6</a>

<p>The interpretation of the tale is as follows:—
</p>
<p>A man and his wife had one son and one daughter. The wife died and the man married
again. But the new wife did not love her step-children and ill-used them. One day
she said to them, “Go down and watch the fields. I will send food down for you every
day. Do not come back to the house.” But instead of food she only sent down rat-dung
and chicken-dung and rice husks tied up in leaves. When the children opened the leaves
they saw that their step-mother had sent them down filth instead of food. Then they
forgot what human food was like and took to picking and eating berries in the jungle.
One day their father brought down some food and called them to come and eat it, but
they said, “We have forgotten what human food is like, father. We are turning into
monkeys.” With these words they called out “wu-wu” and turned into monkeys. Then their
father said, “You have turned into monkeys, and now you will watch for the days when
the villagers are keeping <i lang="njh">emung</i> and cannot go to the fields, and will scratch up the roots and seeds they have sown.”
That is why to this day monkeys scratch up the roots and seeds in the fields when
they see that the village is keeping <i lang="njh">emung</i>.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The figurative expressions used by Lhotas in jest or for purposes of abuse are so
apt and to the point that they deserve brief notice. A dwarfish person is called either
<span class="pageNum" id="pb225">[<a href="#pb225">225</a>]</span><i lang="njh">hampochütang</i> (fowl’s-dung) or <i lang="njh">zitsenaro</i> (mouse). A woman of loose morals is called <i lang="njh">nyanyavu</i> (she-goat) or <i lang="njh">ntsingo</i> (a small fish with the reputation of taking any bait thrown to it). The expression
<i lang="njh">wokomhi</i> (pig’s tail) is applied to a fussy man who is always running backwards and forwards.
<i lang="njh">Nangkinangka</i> (chrysalis) denotes a sulky man. <i lang="njh">Shamakok</i> (wasp) is a man with a very small waist. <i lang="njh">Potak</i> (duck) is a man who waggles his posterior as he walks. In a quarrel a man will sometimes
address his opponent as <i lang="njh">sakaptso</i> (“born under the verandah of the house,” <i>i.e.</i> bastard), and will be called <i lang="njh">songkoptso</i> (“born under the granary”) in return. A man with no teeth is nicknamed <i lang="njh">okingkham</i> (open door), and so on.

<h3 class="main"><i>Baby Language.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An English mother who says to her baby, “Didums wantum’s bottleums denums?” uses language
sufficiently like that in ordinary use to be intelligible to a mere bachelor, but
the Lhotas have a curious custom, when addressing small children, of using words which
are in no way connected with the speech of every-day life. For instance, “boiled rice”
is called <i lang="njh">mama</i>, “madhu” is <i lang="njh">koko</i>, “rain” is <i lang="njh">tsetse</i>, “eat” is <i lang="njh">hamto</i>, “go to sleep” is <i lang="njh">shoboto</i>, “get up” is <i lang="njh">hoksi</i>, “sit down” is <i lang="njh">phato</i>, “go along” is <i lang="njh">tsatsato</i>, “I will smack you” is <i lang="njh">khakto</i>, and so on.
</p>
<p>The origin of this baby dialect is unknown, but it is noticeable that the Aos use
almost identical words in addressing their children.

</p>
<ul>
<li><i lang="njh">Ndri</i> (February). “The month of the <i lang="njh">ndri</i> flower.”
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Emhu</i> (March). “The blowing month.”
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Ephi</i> (April). “The dry month.”
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Cheshi</i> (May). “The watching month,” <i>i.e.</i> all watch to see if the crops will sprout well.
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Oten</i> (June). “The month of millet” (<i lang="njh">teni</i>).
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Nnung</i> (July). Derivation unknown.
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Chikanika</i> (August). “The month of quarrels,” because poor men have come to the end of their
resources and try to borrow from rich men, who refuse to lend.
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Ndrangtso</i> (September). “The bursting month,” because the pots are bursting with new rice.
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Rongorongyi</i> (October). “The going backwards and forwards month,” <i>i.e.</i> carrying the crop up to the village.
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Chopuk</i> (November). “The month of ease.”
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Shotokuk</i> (December). “The month of ceremonies.”
</li>
<li><i lang="njh">Echon</i> (January). “The spreading month,” <i>i.e.</i> the rats scatter the straw about the abandoned fields.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>In order to correct the calendar an extra month or part of a month called <i lang="njh">Chotantsu</i> is put in after <i lang="njh">Echon</i> whenever <span class="pageNum" id="pb227">[<a href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>necessary.

the crops are late may be struggling through <i lang="njh">Chikanika</i> while those of a warm village are enjoying the peace and plenty of <i lang="njh">Ndrangtso</i>.

<p class="first">There is no standard of weight in use throughout the tribe, but in every village there
is kept a stone (<i lang="njh">ephwa</i>) which is used in apportioning the shares of meat at feasts. The weight is generally
nine to ten pounds. For trade a balance of the bismar type is used, notched to weigh
in Indian seers and fractions of seers.
</p>
<p>The standard measure for rice is <i lang="njh">chukoluk</i>, which is regarded as one man’s wage for a day and usually weighs about six pounds.

<p>Two baskets (<i lang="njh">etek</i>) are regarded as going to one <i lang="njh">enokyak</i>. The size of the baskets varies from village to village, and the buyer must accept
the standard of the village from which he buys.
</p>
<p>Though nowadays Lhotas occasionally try to state distance in English miles, the real
measure is by <i lang="njh">echen</i>, the distance between one temporary granary and that at the next stage on the path
up from the fields. It varies from village to village. On an easy slope it may be
a mile and a half, on a steep slope it will be a mile or even less.
</p>
<p>The depth of water is either measured in <i lang="njh">echam</i> (the height of a man) or <i lang="njh">eshi</i> (kicks). That is to say, if a man having dived to the bottom of a pool has to kick
his legs three times before he reaches the top, the pool is reckoned as three “kicks”
deep. A tree is spoken of as so many <i lang="njh">phunchap</i> (ladder-steps) high.
</p>
<p>Just as fingers and toes are the usual counting apparatus, <span class="pageNum" id="pb229">[<a href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>so the Lhota uses the distance between the various parts of his body as standards
of measurement. The distance between the tips of the fingers of the outstretched arms
is called <i lang="njh">ntiya</i>, and that from the middle of the chest to outstretched finger-tips <i lang="njh">monyak</i>. A cubit is <i lang="njh">kecha</i>. The spans of the thumb and first finger and thumb and middle finger are <i lang="njh">ekohundro</i> and <i lang="njh">ekosüpo</i> respectively. The breadth of a finger is <i lang="njh">yingro</i>. These measurements are used for all conceivable purposes. The size of a mithan,
for instance, is not stated in terms of its height at the withers, but in terms of
the length of its horn in <i lang="njh">ekosüpo</i> and <i lang="njh">yingro</i>. Similarly, to measure a pig you pass a long slip of bamboo round its chest and measure
the bamboo. Thread is never measured by length or weight. If it is in a skein, the
thickness round the skein is taken, the circles formed by thumb and first finger and
thumb and middle finger being called <i lang="njh">etsokhundro</i> and <i lang="njh">etsoksüpo</i> respectively. If it is in a ball, the ball is reckoned as a <i lang="njh">keraksüpo</i> (big handful) or <i lang="njh">keraktero</i> (little handful).

<h3 class="main">HUMAN SACRIFICE</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Major Butler gives the following account<a class="noteRef" id="n230.1src" href="#n230.1">2</a> of a human sacrifice: “About the 27th July, 1850, Lieutenant Vincent succeeded in
effecting, for thirty-seven rupees, the ransom of Tooleram, a Cacharee boy, who had
been carried off from the village of Loongee-jair on the 18th February by a marauding
party of Angahmee Nagahs. Two other children were at the same time carried off, but
had been sold to other villages; a little girl was sold to some Nagahs at Beereh-mah,
but could not be traced. The fate of the third boy was horrible; he was purchased
by the adjoining tribe of Lotah Nagahs, and a man of the village having died immediately
after the purchase, it was considered a bad omen, and that ill luck had befallen them
on account of this captive child. They therefore flayed the poor boy alive, cutting
off his flesh bit by bit until he died. These cruel and superstitious savages then
divided the body, giving a piece of the flesh to each man in the village to put into
his <i lang="njh">dolu</i>, a large corn-basket. By this they suppose all evil will be averted, their good fortune
will return, and plentiful crops of grain will be ensured.”
</p>
<p>Nagas are always ready to give garbled, not to say scandalous, accounts of the customs
of their neighbours, and there can be little doubt that Major Butler was misled by
his Angami informants. Lhotas, in common with other tribes, believe in a vague sort
of way that the taking of a head brings prosperity to the taker’s village, and the
boy was probably killed and his body cut up and distributed, as was done more recently
in the case of the Nankam slave <span class="pageNum" id="pb231">[<a href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>bought by Akuk. But there is no tradition that it was ever the custom to torture victims
before death, and I think the Lhotas must be acquitted of this charge. It would, further,
be clean contrary to their customs to put pieces of human flesh in their rice, which
would thereby become polluted rather than blessed.<a class="noteRef" id="n231.1src" href="#n231.1">3</a>
</p>
<p>The story goes that long, long ago a rich Lhota was very ill. In vain pigs, cattle
and mithan were slaughtered. Finally he had one of his slaves sacrificed in cold blood,
in the hope that the slave’s life would be accepted in place of his own. The man died,
however, in spite of this last sacrifice, and Lhotas, seeing that it was unavailing,
have never imitated his example. This tradition and the practice of spearing the <i lang="njh">opya</i> at the <i lang="njh">oyantsoa</i> “genna” point to a time when human sacrifice was practised to avert evil fortune,
but it would be safe to say that within historical times no such custom has been followed
by them.

<p class="first">As far as possible Naga-Assamese words have been avoided. For the following, however,
no convenient English equivalents exist.

Angami <i lang="njm">kenna</i>, of which the word is a corruption (<i>e.g.</i> “my house is genna to-day”).
</p>
<p><i>jhum.</i> Naga cultivation (see description on p. 45). Also used = a field which has been cultivated
in this way.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
